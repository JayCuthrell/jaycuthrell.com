        "excerpt":"People often ask me “Why Qthrul? Why fudge?” Well, my last name has been slaughtered by many people in an attempt to master the correct pronunciation which is Fooonafoonapingere. Okay, maybe not, it is like the word qthrul reads: Q - Thrul. As a result cooterell, cuthrill (try living up to this one), cutterell coochie cooter and a slew of other such bastardizations have come into being since my last name isn’t all that common. Well, until I got online and search engines went to work. Okay now for fudge, yes I know, kinda weird for a nickname or even a login name or whatever. It all started with MUDs (actually chatters) based back in the days of MegaDiner when boxes were things one would telnet to remember those days? (try this with NT4.0 for real fun) Anyhow, I chose the nick “fudge” since I am sinfully sweet and rich. Maybe not, but I am an engineer and most good engineering involves some sorta “fudge” factor. So now you know, I am Jay “something witty inserted here” Cooterell, Inc. and my home is fudge. Oh, the Jay “something witty inserted here” Cooterell, Inc. comes from my USENET posts. I try to always sign off with it. And I am fudge as well, you getting all this? If you know me at all online you know I detest single periods, ellipsis is my tool of flow and I use it quite liberally. So, welcome to my HTML-ized world of controlled image leaching that I call my home page. There are a few things about me, pics of me and others I know, love and/or happened to be nearby when a camera was handy. My random thoughts that are even more randomly added to, some nifty art stuff that considering I am not an artist. I am kinda proud of, actually I do glean your IP or hostname so, and links to those I know, love and/or think are cool enough to justify a link in this massively threaded world that HTTP makes possible. So far we have come from the days of Mosaic and Lynx. If you are from N.C. please note that I am from North Carolina and I always like to hear from people that have been here or left here screaming. If you use ICQ or Mirabilis I am 1351835 at work and 4663668 at home. On AIM or AOL Instant Messenger or Oscar for the ole school types I am on as qthrul. If you are on CU-SeeMe much look for me.If you are on iVisit don’t be offended if you get a “Busy Now”.Yes, I am Fudge on there too.On IRC you might find me or not since I never got sucked into that scene. If you don’t see me it is because I am still there only hiding from you so that I can finish knitting you a sweater. ","categories": ["random"],

        "excerpt":"Greetings from Tel Aviv. My body says it is noon. Everyone else here says it is 7 hours later. The flight sucked so much it isn’t funny. First, all my connects are late, then I get to the ticketing counter and they tell me they are overbooked and since I am late to check in they gave away my seat. I did much protesting and turned on the charm. Okay, so I asked a manager for help, many many many hours later I am off the ground at JFK (delays) and headed to Tel Aviv. Boy, that trans atlantic food just gets better and better every time. I have taken pics with my old camera since I couldn’t bear losing the Nikon to random mishap. My room is facing the sea. The sunset tonight was simply gorgeous. This place reminds me so much of Huntington Beach. The only difference is that everyone talks Hebrew and the buildings look like post-shell shock era. Oh, I am doing this from a magic port in the hotel room of another person here with me in the same hotel. I say magic because you dial out and it just “knows”.

(farewell everyone)Scient family, 3 years ago I joined a company called iXL. In doing so, I joined a small growing office in Raleigh that connected to a larger office in Charlotte that connected to the mothership that would rule the Internet and/or Earth. :smile: Fast forward to today and I am the last person from what was the Carolinas. I’ve been working out of the NC office (see also: Jay’s House) for over a year now. That’s meant, travel!!! :smile: What a ride. Traveling for client projects has allowed me to experience:   Dry ribs and routers in Memphis  Flat beer and Red Hat Linux in RTP  Mongolian BBQ and Solaris in Charlotte  Free cheese and Geeks @ the Beach in Miami  Tuna steaks and J2EE vaporware in Denver  Rick James impersonators and SQL*Server issues in Columbus  Yak’s brain and S-MIME wizardry in Israel  Gnats and corporate plane ride “strategery” with CIO’s in Florida  Free Mexican buffet and HP Tech Symposium I in San Jose  Carson’s BBQ and HP-UX in Chicago  A single male’s Valentines Day and VoIP in NYC  Harold’s Deli and Weblogic in NJ  Girly man BBQ :wink: and working with gurus in Dallas  Free steak dinner and the HP Tech Symposium II in Tampa  Deja vu and DLT Robot autoloaders in Richmond  Enjoying Rio and PKI framework in Brazil  Pad Thai and Intel Online Services (oops) in DCToday is my last day with Scient.

        "excerpt":"I’d like to see a skit on SNL about the “Who Am I Kidding” calling plan from Verizon. Video: Urban man age 25-35. Bad hair. Frumpy. Bad choice of clothing. Sitting on bus stop bench in city. Checking his cell phone and seeing an empty list when selecting “Received Calls”. Voice over: You’ve got a great cell phone. It takes pictures. Tons of games. It even plays soundtrack to Lord of the Rings when you get the weather report update. You even get unlimited minutes for people that call you and unlimited minutes to call anyone nationwide. Video: Man looks into camera, has a big grin, then nods affirmatively and makes a “yeah, I’m cool” face. Voice over: But the bill is, well, hard to justify given your social life. That’s why Verizon is now offering the “Who Am I Kidding Plan”. Sure, you have a cell phone, but let’s be realistic. Nobody calls you. Really. We mean it. Nobody calls you. Video: Man face sinks into a depressing expression and kind of nods a sheepish affirmation. Voice over: And most likely, nobody ever will. You see, you’re just not popular. In fact, we know from our own call analysis that people don’t even answer your calls. That’s right. They go straight to their voice mail. We’re excited to offer this calling plan to you and others like you. We’ll even make it so you don’t have to wait for the other person you call to let it ring into their voice mail. We’ll send your calls straight there. You’ll feel better knowing your message was left and you didn’t have to put the person you called on the spot. Nobody likes a pest and with the “Who Am I Kidding Plan” you won’t be! Video: Man looks into camera, has a big grin, then nods affirmatively and makes a “maybe I am cool” face then a “hey, wait a minute……” face Voice over: That’s right! And, with our nationwide all digital network your voice mails will be crystal clear when they forward through it or don’t hit delete quickly enough to avoid hearing it! Video: The man looks up just as the Verizon “Can you hear me now?” guy is walking by the bench. The man is visibly excited and tries to make eye contact but the Verizon guy just acts like he didn’t see him and rushes to put his cell phone to his ear (upside down) to perpetrate like he is taking an important call as he shuffles away from the man quickly. Man makes face as if to say, “Yeah, hey no problem, you’re busy, I’ll catch you later” as his face sinks back into the same depressing expression. Voice over: Verizon. We never stop working for you. Even if nobody cares if you exist. ","categories": [],

        "title": "Cat Diapers",
        "excerpt":"I was trying to figure out where cat poop goes. Yes, this is my life. So, as I live in Raleigh I asked the waste folks (they have email) the question:   Subject: Pet fecal matter in Raleigh garbage?   XXXXX,I was reviewing the following information on Raleigh-NC.org and was trying to determine what to do with pet fecal matter. The following link was returned titled “Garbage Preparation”.I see the following under what NOT to put in the garbage:   “Do not put these items in your garbage:   ..   ..Loose cat litter or animal waste (disposable diapers and animal litter should be free of fecal matter and enclosed in a plastic bag before placing in the garbage cart)”   So, if I am reading this right, one cannot put fecal matter in the garbage? Or, should I read this as fecal matter and cat litter should be separated?   Thanks,   Jay I got a response in less than 12 hours and apparently, you can put diapers on cats!   Subject: RE: Pet fecal matter in Raleigh garbage?   Fecal matter should be removed from litter (or diapers) and flushed down the toilet where it is properly treated by the sewage plant. Thanks for asking. I forgot to ask how to dispose of all the blood soaked bandages after putting the diaper on the cat. Fast forward…. Tonight, as I go through Pet Smart I see this advertised:   “LitterLocker® gives cat lovers an odorless, hygienic, easy way to dispose of waste. Pet owners simply scoop and sift clumps in a regular litter box using the litter scoop included with the unit, open the lid and discard the waste in the LitterLocker® container.” So, now I am wondering if people are secretly buying these and discarding pet waste in their regular garbage collection in Raleigh and thereby possibly breaking the law? Here’s video footage that could be supplied to the authorities: It also looks like there is an automated machine for breaking the law as well! Where’s 20/20 when you need them? ","categories": [],

        "title": "Internet access",
        "excerpt":"I was listening to TSOT on NPR this morning. This was made possible due to my new early to bed and early to rise experiment. The subject was related to productivity and Internet access in the workplace. There was a lot of anecdotal evidence and people called in to say why they felt the Internet was good or bad for productivity. The real issue, in my mind, is management techniques. Often, there is management in a company setting and it is monotone. I say monotone to describe a management technique where the manager assumes that everyone is either a) a big boy/girl or b) a complete ninny that requires massive micromanagement. It’s pretty rare, at least in my limited experience, to see a manager that can shift gears. I’ve been in and around IT for the majority of my career and it clicked with me when a caller described problem solvers and quota workers. Problem solvers are those that figure complex things out that don’t come with a great deal of instructions and are left to figure it out for themselves by a deadline or milestone. Quota workers have a detailed workflow and an expected output over a period of time but with more frequent deadlines. I think that the animosity towards a manager can stem from treating problem solvers as quota workers. This is sometimes described as trying to make the creative put out in a timely fashion. Well, as they (those that are creative) say, you cannot rush inspiration. So, then there are quota workers that require constant supervision. Or do they? I got the feeling that putting an IT manager on the floor of a blue collar construction or assembly line might be a fish out of water story. Then I started thinking about the rotation programs in larger companies that put wunderkinds on a crash course in all the parts of the business. This lets them do everything from assembling the widgets to sitting in on the top brass meetings about those widgets. So, back to Internet access. There is a lot of Internet access filtering/proxy/session hijack products and services out there that market themselves as tools to shape employee productivity. I say shape since I am still not convinced the word improve can be used without some amount of marketing lobotomy. Also, when there is a browser on the desktop, it is probably something default and it just leads to frustration and loss of cycles through having to get past the MSN homepage load each time, then wondering if some people use a bookmark or try to type in http:\\ each time they want to go somewhere. I’ve watched people that have never grown up around the Internet tools. It’s pretty scary to watch. They don’t want to know what is going on with the GUI. This is why phish scams work. It looks right. People click. All this was going though my mind as the Internet access talk continued on the radio. I kept wondering if someone had considered that Internet access might not be the real issue. Maybe the real issue is that the way people access the Internet is flawed from a productivity standpoint. As I drove up to the recycling bins (the real reason for my early morning trip), I saw the overflowing massive bin reserved for phone books. Yes, phone books. All that Internet access and I wondered why there are still phone books. Perhaps, the Internet access just isn’t as productive as it could be.

I wonder if we’ll wake up one morning with a massive hangover? I remember what Tom Selleck promised 11 years ago. You will? Well, I’m still waiting. I suppose after MCI/Quest/SBC/AT&amp;T/Verizon/BellSouth/etc… is done coming back together there is a chance. But as these companies slash and burn to right size, I can’t see where the heavy R&amp;D will be coming from to make decade old promises come any closer to reality. Sure, there are elements of the promises around today. One could argue they are even possible to some degree — but the promise was of the ubiquitous not the proof of concept. I guess I’ll still be fighting with self check out at the grocery store for a few years more…  Oooh… nice innovation…. you get the customer to do the work of a grocery store clerk.

        "title": "Export restrictions",
        "excerpt":"I’ve got a Mac. I have a metric ton of contacts (+10k). One might expect this makes for an elegant and natural fit since there is Address Book for the Mac. Having lots of contacts should mean you are able to communicate with those contacts. Or, maybe that you want to feel like you are making up for lost time when you were the last kid picked for kickball. In either case, you want it to be a simple matter for keeping these contacts updated. Plaxo is useful for automation of the update process. LinkedIn is useful for the mining of these contacts and the relationships that flow from them. .Mac just works with my Mac. I’ve also got a .Mac email account that can use the iSync managed Address Book I store there. I’ve also got a Gmail account. So, why can’t they all just get along? Jason Calacanis noted noted the absence of Gmail functionality to export contacts. He goes on to mention his goal is to sync up with LinkedIn. I periodically ping their feature request form to request the same export functionality. Sadly, I can only export from Plaxo to LinkedIn — but not the other way. So far, I’ve ended up writing a perl script to just strip away LinkedIn contact listings to the format I need. You’ll also recall that export from Orkut was extremely simple — and it is another Google property. Then, I can dump these into Address Book once they are in Plaxo since Plaxo has a vCard export feature that works. At this point, Plaxo is the only thing that seems to want to play well with others. Well, If you are on my LinkedIn or have access to my Plaxo then you know I try to maintain both. Yes, I’ve got a bluetooth phone that can sync with the Mac via Address Book and iSync. Yes, I’ve got a .Mac account so that I can maintain contacts there. The ultimate would be universal sync of a vCard service or something that gave a central repository like .Mac that you could dip across via API from other services such as LinkedIn and Plaxo that both have different goals but require a database of your contacts. Also, there are some folks that I don’t put in LinkedIn or Plaxo because of the sometimes nebulous stance on privacy that these services might project, infer, exhibit, or evolve. So, if there was a dip ready service out there it would have to have a few features that no service (I’ve seen) has yet. There would have to be opt in and opt out that could be controlled by the contact. Oh, now that’s a prickly concept. Think of all those “We Care About Your Privacy [tm]” pamphlets that you get in the snail mail regarding how financial service groups sell protect your privacy and personal information. Does that mean for this fictional service — when I add you to my contact list — would you get a copy of my intentions and the privacy policy of the service sent to you with the ability to allow for your inclusion in this service? Or, would it just add you and now I’ve become another attack against your privacy? If you have used Plaxo for any period of time you know that many email administrators simply block anything and everything that Plaxo tries to send on your behalf. Plaxo lets you handle bounces and some of them have very informative messages from the email administrator (well, their servers) that politely say “pound sand” and “your kind is not welcome here”. So, Plaxo might want to play well with others, but it does not mean everyone will let their children out to play with them. That makes Plaxo the kid with the really cool bike that other kids want to play with but the parents don’t trust completely. ","categories": ["NeoNova and Digitel","random"],

        "excerpt":"[ Everything after the Etch A Sketch has been an exercise in escalating support demands. Consider that simply shaking it like a Polaroid picture puts you right back to a pristine operating state. Loss of productivity from email is symptomatic. Rethinking how email is used would mean there might be a problem… whether or not email is creating a problem is greatly dependent on the organization and how they are geographically structured, on site interpersonal dynamics, and the chain of command approach to leading by example. Email can be highly asymmetric with traditional desktop clients. Blackberry and other push type messaging services seek to bring a symmetric flow but, as with any tool, it requires the user to read and comprehend. This assumes that email flows — spam, queuing, and poor MUA design in the UI make a lot of email go unread or buried in the haystack (so-called vacation dread). Still, some abuses of email features and flow are why email etiquette and guides towards sending better emails should be shared with company members. Oddly enough, this can be done via email. :smile: Instant messaging (IM) is often considered by a lot of pundits as state where email will evolve to. However, IM is still at the mercy of presence. Just as with a Blackberry push of email to gain immediacy, the sender has no control over the far end reading and comprehending. They can always walk away from the desktop/laptop. That’s not always a bad thing if they are going to talk with someone but in a crunch period with remote teams, it can be devastating if the walking party is in the critical path. Voice is immediate symmetric one to one communication (face to face, telepresence, phone call) or immediate one to many mild asymmetric communication (staff meeting, telepresence, conference bridge) if you can reasonable assume the parties on the far end are listening and comprehending. With face to face and staff meetings you get the benefit (hopefully!) of proxemics. People should use voice more if they are spending too much time in email or finding frustration with IM if they are not part of an email or IM culture oriented company. Sometimes, the use of voice is a cost concern or an availability concern. Most often this revolves around the notion of presence. Emails are fire and forget. So is voice mail – especially in unified messaging scenarios where workers know the far end gets the voicmail as an email attachment. Real time voice requires a lot more work and, frankly, confrontation. Instant messaging is thought to be a way to gain some idea of presence for the far end of a possible conversation. Of course, if someone isn’t looking at the screen or isn’t near the phone, even the best find me follow me PBX feature won’t help connect parties – mobile phones get turned off and left on the desk or forgotten at home. FWIW, I think Iotum for Blackberry and other presence engines are a great idea — assuming that like any tool for communication: the other team members have to use it as well or better than you do! As one peer once told me: “I look forward to the day when technology allows us to use mobile phones for more than just web, email, SMS, and instant messaging. I envision a future where people are able to use mobile phones for real time voice communications. Here’s to the future!” ","categories": ["NeoNova and Digitel","telecom"],

        "title": "CALEA and Me",
        "excerpt":"[ May 14th is the official deadline for cable modem companies, DSL providers, broadband over powerline, satellite internet companies and some universities to finish wiring up their networks with FBI-friendly surveillance gear, to comply with the FCC’s expanded interpretation of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act source: Wired For the past 6 months I’ve been doing a lot of talking, travel, and geekercise related to this very topic.  CALEA has taken me far and wide.  One of the many problems I have with it is the ecosystem of fear, uncertainty, and doubt that preys upon my customer base.  It is a subject I’ve stood in front of phone companies and stated that as a card carrying Libertarian and tax payer that the whole mess just makes me angrier each time I reflect upon it. On the one hand, it’s “the law” now so you can’t just ignore it.  On the other hand, the majority law enforcement wouldn’t know an IP address from a socket wrench. There are two kinds of broadband CALEA intercepts and both are real time – as “it” happens:  Trap and trace, and full content. Trap and trace is basically this IP (person/machine) talked to this IP (person/machine).  It’s like in the movies where they can see the calls happening in real time. This is real time call records for the Interweb. Example: Joe Target is surfing myspace right now! p0 n03s! Lock him up! Bar Camp Rdu Calea Lawful Intercept View more documents from Jay Cuthrell. Full content is the nightmare scenario everyone chimes in about because it is whatever comes across the wire for this IP (person/machine).  It’s like in the movies where they are listening to the calls in real time.  Example: Joe Target has a Yahoo! Messenger pounce message set up for a hottie on myspace and Joe is clicking on the hottie profile on myspace right now! p0 n0ez! Lock him up! The good news, if there is any, is that mediation is the process by which the provider keeps the law enforcement agency (LEA) at arms reach. Basically, mediation is accomplished by letting a box or collection of boxes a) connect up to the physical network taps and/or manage the industry crafted backdoors in routersb) specify the warrant/court order in question for a specific duration of time for an IP address or other identifier (MAC, ports, etc.)c) reformat any/all collected data in a format easily digested by another LEA controlled system somewhere else So, basically, the LEA asks for X at time T for duration Y and this is essentially sent to the LEA in near real time. The provider does the provisioning for the lawful intercept and the magic mediation platform -send- the LEA what they asked for and only what they asked for in the hopefully narrow definition and scope contained within the authorized court order, again in real time. That said… some of these boxes fit in a carry on bag. Very powerful, highly portable… it’s a brave new world. So, given the egregious abuses of National Security Letters and their chilling effects, I have to wonder if any of this infrastructure for broadband CALEA will be used as intended or if the powers requesting information will simply throw down the “exigent” card. The “exigent” card? That’s like in the movies where the FBI hero gets to surf through mountains of real time data because the ends justify the means. In practical matters, it means that government is directly coupled to broadband plants and gains information by whatever means necessary. See also: get out of my way, I’m trying to save the world[tm]! your kung fu is weak! I will put in my own box and suck from the river of data and find the needle in the haystack! Most folks have heard of carnivore, echelon, and other wide net applications for collecting data for governments. My issue with the exigent card is that there is a lot of haystack getting caught up in what should be a narrow scope. See also the unilateral wet dream monologue scene from “Enemy of the State”. On the other hand, I’ve never seen government get anything right. Ever. In other words, if the frikking RIAA with all their high paid consultants can’t get it right when saying someone at an IP address was X — how will the government when they rely on those same consultants and contractors? [ So, my only real fear in any of this is that people will resort to encryption and then the legislators will move focus to private industry that force backdoor keys for everything that eventually get compromised and we move back to private enterprise and organized crime having better tools than even a Dudley Dooright trying to make a difference. All the folks I know at FBI (about a dozen or so) are quite data savvy make me feel better they are on our side… in that they know IP is not the end all be all of reality. Healthy disrespect of computers that do not make mistakes is a hallmark of someone I want thinking about these problems… but CALEA can and does extend as a concept to something a local police office and get involved with… yikes. And in the end, record keeping and billing systems involve humans. Things can, do, and will continue to go wrong. It’s just I’ve heard of Dudley Dooright breaking down the wrong door far too many times. It’s just that after reading a blog from a friend of mine that lives (reluctantly) in China now, it’s very apparent that we still have it pretty damn good over here. In summary: What a load of horse shit. ","categories": ["NeoNova and Digitel","telecom"],

        "title": "The Taco Thesis",
        "excerpt":"[ Last week I attended SXSW Interactive.  My goal was to expand my mind. I’m calling this The Taco Thesis for numerous reasons.   First, I walked a lot during the week and didn’t eat well either resulting in operating at a caloric deficit even with tacos calling to me at each turn.  Second, the tasty breakfast tacos during one of the more interesting pitches were filling.  Third, my reflection on how quickly a room fills with just the mention of breakfast tacos at noon is telling – yes, free punch and pie does work. In the pick two world of fast, cheap, and right – where right is never reached – this was a conference overflowing with information.  My goal was to push immediate thoughts and musings directly into the fluid medium with post event collection and publishing (see also: this post).  I used mobile devices that fit in my pocket to make this happen.  I used linked services (fire and forget) to make it accessible online. I’ll be blunt and say that this post is more to get down my thoughts in a single post than to extract from the raw ore of my notes and produce a delicate strand of ductile and malleable wisdom. I met a ton of my long time and newly created Internet heroes.  I broke bread with them.  I chillaxed with them.  I hugged them.  I was even blown off and dissed by them.  These stories are the stories that are mine though and aren’t really something I feel the need to put into writing.  Each talk was a moment and each thought shared was something that helped me grow and think more about from here forward. It was the people pure and simple.  100% pure people powered goodness. It was pretty cool, I gotta say. And now for the semi-sweet ultra-big over moderately neato ideas: Essentials for getting there and staying there: The three most important things I brought with me were: Blackberry, Camera Phone, Business Cards. Blackberry - while I wish I had an iPhone, it just isn’t going to happen until there is a way to use it with other carriers.  The Blackberry gave me access to twitter (major use) and dodgeball (less used).  I could also reload my sched.org from the Blackberry.  More important though, the Blackberry wasn’t a laptop.  A laptop is a tool if you are working or writing at the show and I frankly saw a laptop as a distraction or one more reason to be tethered to a wall for power.  So, if it isn’t your job to cover or be paid to be there - leave the laptop behind. [ Camera phone - This was the limiting factor of the three.  It’s not a great phone but it is small.  The camera is only useful in very strong lighting.  In retrospect a better hybrid might have been an iPod Touch that could make use of WiFi but this would limit use in dead spots where the ubiquitous Austin WiFi might not be available.  Or, as many folks learned, the conference WiFi was not stable.  The lesson from trying to use an actual digital camera on the first day was the extra mega pixels are lost on me and the pocket clutter cannot be ignored.  Also, with a digital camera there is the extra step of finding a laptop, mounting the camera, opening the photo editor, moving files or shifting them rotation wise, sucking them into an area as ready to publish, uploading to Flickr, etc…  By comparison, with a camera phone, I simply took a photo then “Sent” to the Flickr blog posting email address that gave me double posting duty by simultaneously posting to my WordPress install on fudge.org.  Are the camera phone photos going to get me into JPG magazine?  No.  And, that’s not the point.  The point is timely upload for the Polaroid moment shared with anyone there.   The other benefit of the Flickr approach to posting in the blog is hitting the WordPress Twitter Tools plug-in that notified everyone following me on Twitter that I had created a new “post”.   Granted, the text area on a mobile phone is a limiting experience when creating a blog entry but the effect was proof of concept.  I still have iPhone envy. Business Cards - Quaint anachronism?  Perhaps.  Perhaps in days past when IR transmitter enabled PIMs were all the rage, beaming a contact card over was the talking cat.  Today it seems that business cards are making a comeback due to the low cost of high quality printing and design constraints that have gone the way of the dinosaur.  I came up with a new design that would include my basic contact information in terms of my blog, twitter, IM, and my personal mobile number in the event someone wanted to call me and talk.  Oddly enough, nobody called. Heh.  I had some from Kinkos on heavy stock but the real cards were shipped to my hotel direct by Zazzle. [ Too bad I didn’t do faster shipping options as only a select few got the Zazzle cards whereas most of my Kinkos cards were handed out already – the Zazzle cards (and the gum stick like dispensers) got a lot of compliments and putting my head on there was a better idea that I had imagined. [ My SXSW badge was pretty limited in terms of photogenic representation.  Heh. The packing I did for the weather was layered. [ Austin was colder than I imagined but due to my packing strategy that was a good thing.  I also packed for no laundry.       7 pairs of socks, underwear, tee shirts         5 button down synthetic fiber dress shirts (biz casual)         2 “social” shirts         1 pair of jeans, shorts         1 pair walking shoes         1 pair workout shoes         1 leather jacket         1 windbreaker         1 pair prescription sunglasses         1 IKEA toiletry kit with travel size items   After selection the travel day outfit, this collection fits into a standard carry on bag or a large backpack when folded properly.  I use garment organizers too maximize space.  Wow.  I never thought I’d use that phrase when I was a kid. As a result, no checking of baggage was required.  Assuming there is hotel laundry is a bit dicey since there might be a few hundred other people with the same people in the same hotels that day. I flew Delta direct ATL to AUS direct.  My Platinum status helped me to a free upgrade and I was early enough to relax in the Delta Crown Room.  It also gave me the chance to connect pre-conference with a new media superhero. A lot of other folks encountered weather, flight changes, and general travel hell. Checking bags is a huge liability when you want to travel with flexibility but for the folks that tirelessly covered this event as part of their jobs… I salute you. I’d only recommend others take a trade show booth worker approach as well to lighten and limber travel options.  To that end, I might FedEx clothes ahead if expect colder weather next year or wish to extend to. Next year?  Yes.  I am that positive I will be back again assuming I don’t get hit by a bus. The other thing I’ve learned is that staying very far away from the event is peaceful but not ideal.  I actually got a reservation at the Marriott near the airport.  That was a little too peaceful.  However, next year I am going to stay at the Marriott closer to the event or even at the Hilton itself as much as I don’t like staying in Hilton properties. Things that made my head expand a bit more than I expected from SXSW: After a presentation involving breakfast tacos, I see companies like Get Satisfaction taking over the role of Usenet as a support and feedback channel from technology companies in the 90s. The key elements of how social networking changed the feedback loop are a) ease of access b) self grouping and c) removing silos of authentication a) Ease of access is where the tools are readily available to all the user and across the various aspects within the enterprise and the outside supplier and customer views as well.  This approach will bring greater community involvement with a maturity model similar to political involvement – passion brings involvement. b) Self grouping will let the like minded and like interested teams find and rally around products, products, and initiatives without being lumped into what the enterprise -decides- to logically group.  The point being that the social network will determine what is sensibly grouped and when.  The enterprise will benefit from knowing what the various users and aspects truly highlight as valued discussions. c) By removing silos of authentication (i.e. a web forum tied only to usernames/passwords/profiles unique to a specific company) the need to register, sign away your direct marketing rights for resale, and otherwise recreate your namespace within yet another sign up page (YASUP) is replaced by a unified notion of identity or leverage of familiar and acceptable means of gaining access to a resource or service.  By taking away YASUP the user base can be free to shift from one destination to the next while retaining elements of their identity that are pertinent to finding the inter-community circles that bring concepts such as reputation, peering, and otherwise finding the birds of a feather they can agree with or disagree with on any given topic or free discussion. Things that I think would make SXSW even more amazing if it was present: White Board Room - there should be an entire room filled with white boards and the dry erase markers and cleaning erasers to keep everyone happy.  In front of each board there should be a cheap megapixel IP web cam or even a marker tape showing the best place to take a photo of the white board.  This would be a lot nicer than the back of napkins or, in my case, the dinner menu. SXSWg or SXSW Games - there was such a huge amount of gamer presence there it felt like they should have their own show.  The argument might be made that this is how Interactive came to be but I would have to research that a bit more to determine what shifted the focus to a breakout. Eye recognition software or head tilt recogniation software - this was the first conference I have attended where everyone seemed to have their head down praying into their mobile phone keyboard, iPhone/Touch screen, or laptop plinking away actively.  It would be interesting to have a running tally displayed of head tilt percentages in the crowd if everyone wore a motion sensor that determine if they were looking up at the presentations or down at their devices.  Or, even a background noise detector that monitored for the sound of key clicks or button pressing sounds.  It really sounds like rain on dry leaves if you close your eyes and listen. Things that I am still wanting to get answers to in the wake of SXSW: I’m still wondering what the mobile operator A-link utilization (SS7) looked like as a traffic ramp for all the Twitter txt activityfor SXSW.  I think it would make for an interesting graphic. I’m wondering how customers can reach into the enterprise or how coworkers can communicate within.  It seems that social networking can bring transparency to the dialog.  Are companies ready for that? Things I will likely apply soon from SXSW: So, with this newly expanded mind I’m trying to apply this to my panel and presentation in April at IP Possibilities.  It is highly likely that I am going to have a few ideas thrown in the mix. My semi-summarized thoughts are going to be how rural network operators (ISP, NSP, Telco) visualize the social network in the metrics and language they use day to day.    The challenge is how these operators move from observers to active (benevolent) participants. One thing I noted about SXSW is that I felt, well, geriatric by comparison to most of the attendees.  The energy and spirit of these people is amazing.  I’m sure many were close to age 35 or over 35 but the way they conducted themselves was a youthful zeal. I did reflect on the reality of my condition.  This is the year I will be 36 and begin selecting the next rung in the drop down menu for Age for YASUP. As participation goes, a presentation last year at the NeoNova Summit 2007 from Keith Quattlebaum really hit home with me.  To summarize, it’s not enough to merely listen to buzz around you.  Rather, it is the service providers responsibility to represent itself through the methods of communication that the base selects and uses to discuss their needs and ideas. This relevant photo is via PicApp.com assuming WordPress didn’t eat it due to reliance upon embedded javascript. So, back to the concept of reaching into the provider… This concept is fascinating if you run through a scenario in your head.  Imagine not having to “know someone” within a large corporate structure to be heard or have your concern be seen as common and specific to the base.  Going further, imagine that the faceless corporate structure is allowed to communicate and have a more personal conversation.  I’m more inclined to think Get Satisfaction or similar companies will become a common approach to getting this dialog started.  Hopefully the folks at Get Satisfaction will soak in their own Palmolive. Hopefully I can illustrate pictorially with real ISP data what a social network draw on the network resource appears as in terms of flows, peer communication within the user base of a provider and what this might mean in terms of that most social of networking functions dating back several years — Internet peering. I’m left thinking that many of the companies I’ve been exposed to during SXSW are the electronic equivalent of the Elvis peanut butter mayonnaise banana sandwich that is deep fried.  Yes, Elvis was the original Mashup model architect.       peanut butter is sticky: compelling content that won’t let go         mayo is smooth: easy access via openID         banana is sweet: all the other user bees are swarming around         bread is the gui: prudent user experience elements throughout         frying makes it addictive: community quirks that brings you back again and again   The notion of broadcast TV with fixed schedules is going to be dead if you don’t enable content to flow from below and let kids be the new wave of public broadcasting.  Will adults get it?  Not likely.  Still, there is something about a show everyone can talk about the next day.  Time shifting might not make for the same water cooler discussions.  On demand downloads of shows will shift how people rally around the actors, directors, and studios that produce the product. Teens and access lines are not mixing but mobility will mix and be the baseline for how younger consumers want to be reached and reach out to the world around them – no matter how insular that world might be. Everyone at SXSW that was trying to download the latest episode of The Wire (which I’ve never seen but I’m aware of this thing called TV that has shows on it and a channel known as HBO) but found that the hospitality approach to the captive portal and/or walled garden for Internet access did not mesh well with extended downloads.  Also, the client software (iTunes) doesn’t really expect to have connectivity arrested mid-download.   This highlights how out of touch hospitality access is still lagging behind.  When you can get a better online experience at an Arby’s than you can at a $450 night Hilton… something is not right. Related to this, the high speed internet experience is going to be the new standard for expectations.  The tiers will justify the symetric desires of the few that need publishing ability.  Content creators and personalities will want to push as hard or harder than they pull content today.  Ask 1938 Media what it’s like trying to push up an episode on a highly over saturated wireless connection.  Okay, don’t ask unless you want to laugh until your sides implode._ Note: I’m admittedly slow and had to research back to understand the joke.  I’m okay saying I didn’t get it but now… oh man.  Comedy GOLD._ Microblogging and the microformat is sms via web with rebroadcasting to all parties that care to see it.  This means the service provider SS7 links will feel it if many of your subscriber base follow with SMS updates.  Edge IP offloading will have to find its way further into the rural provider chain to take on this load. VoIP pricing for calls is just a race to zero and kids will see mobile provider features increasingly apply “jump the shark” style mindless approaches to billing or concocted feature plans each passing year. It will go something like this: Hey kids!  Just enable this code to talk to your friends by inverting your arm into a pretzel and SMS 2234501 and pay for each minute you stand on one leg to get a video pushed up to the website that we control and will delete at random if you don’t continue to pay into us. [ The history of online video starting with CU-SeeMe and the requirements back in the early to mid 90’s and timelines that brought us to the Flash enabled interfaces that appeal to webcam standard laptops and desktops using Yahoo! Live or camera phones with unlimited data plans enabled for use with Qik. Icanhascheezburger and other LOL sites show that no matter how silly it might be… it could be the next big thing[tm]. OpenID and the new relevance for the service provider to not be the proprietary lock in for the consumer will shift expectations of service levels and what the subscriber takes with them when the shift to new providers. Crowd wisdom (wiki) vs. mob (see elsewhere) vs. insular control by the few (Digg) will evolve as more study is done with these great social experiments in massively connected groups that wade into various pools and experiences that have interactive one to one, one to many, and many to one concepts. Specifically, I am still reflecting on the impact of a high profile flame out of Lacy and how her celebrity profile might match Ferriss post Today show (bad press = good press?).  Point of fact, I walked up to Tim Ferriss after his presentation and said that I had no idea who he was until I saw a YouTube (now deleted?) of Donnie Deutsch spanking some kid on TV.  I think Tim said he’s been invited on Donnie’s show now.  I don’t know how this relates to strongly regional and localized services but it is still interesting what fame is or what crafts it. What does this mean for people (kids) that are soaking in Palmolive now? From the raising web 2.0 enabled kids round table there were some very polarized opinions. I noted that courseware from MIT and other education on demand initiaves make the brainy kids into self paced marathon runners of the mind.  That’s great.  Okay, now what about the kids that don’t have Internet access at home or that “have” to work after school? I don’t have kids but I learned that library systems are the home ec class and shop class of tomorow.  I took shop and home economics.  We made wood desk weights and rice crispy treats respectively.  This has served me well in life. Is a forced computer literacy vs luddite approach at age 3 a question of communication readiness on the part of the child or another hurdle or enforcment of poor practices? i.e. Tiger Woods might have been born with a putter in his hands… So does this mean computing early equals jwz? Is that good? Scary? Bringing it back to the concerns of service provider: Are the defaults for the ISP router firewall OS and application an indicator of neglect on the part of the parent or the provider charged with giving a kid friendly service option?  And frankly, who defines “kid friendly?” One pervasive theme is that critical research and pattern recognition and coroboration via secondary sources have unlimited potential for varied aspects of the online and offline world.  Kids have to be healthy skeptics.  Perhaps parents that forward along notes without reading snopes.com could learn a few things themselves? Rounding out the areas of concern for the connected childhood is that this is all fine and well for the echo chamber but beware those outside or across the divide — connected is not always the norm and the US has a long way to go towards equal and ready access for all citizens in the great connectivity experiment that is underway. Thoughts from taking back muni wifi panel: This was the only softly lit to dim room I found.  It was quite nice really. In general, a common theme was that business models are the issue with wireless initiatives today. Vos detailed the comparison early on between how everywhere but the US has figured out the way to get this going and to understand cost structures.  She was very clear on how structural separation of network elements in the US have to be opened sooner rather than later. Mac highlighted what Austin WiFi is from the design for political crisis to keeping nodes their own business model no matter how small that model might be.  He regarded financial crisis and SBC and the initial threats — not RF studies and technology.  Technology works itself out but human agreement an territory is old business turned over each day.  His vision of a less invasive “Minority Report” approach to geocoding wifi hot spots and using social profiles to enable targeted advertising was a consistent theme that resonated with the panelists. Bonewald’s hammer was the free and open social network.  She described the lobby for muni wifi that requires heavy networking and bringing a viable business model first and foremost – get the advertising and cooperation with providers in place early and often.  She highlighted that tools for the people prop up the community interest — and ultimately bridge gaps that are known and agreed upon or that manifest in the wake of service creation.  i.e. did you know you needed it before it was available across the street?  To get the jump from “willful political dissidence” to acceptable use is work with the AUP/ToS constraints of the incumbents to enable the user, the community, the project to prosper and raise all ships in the economy. Mac gave an overview of cities that get it: Montreal used wrt54g instead of PC’s for hot spot creation.  Berlin has the best mesh networking but was crippled by patents.  This raised the discussion again around how mesh may not jive with AUP/ToS conflict — and again this takes the user into willful political dissidence.  Lastly, Barcelona is connecting villages using point to multipoint wireless lan.  The goal isn’t to focus solely on Internet – rather the closing of the gap and creation of the connectivity first and foremost. My only stand up and ask a question of the entire conference was in this session.  I wanted to make sure that someone could highlight why community access exclusivity clauses are so important in rural muni environments.  You have people come in that want to overbuild and prey upon a market or community – it is up to the people to understand that the road that is built quickly becomes a toll road if they are not paying attention. End Transmission One thing I found by using twitter as a tool for taking notes is that I was often taking down condensed wording to fit into 140 characters.  I don’t know if this is good or bad but I did manage to write some really bad poetic verse: A swollen digit on the hand of creativity is marked by the immobile attack of the problem and is rendered a mere blunt instrument of goals Yep.  That’s pretty much how my thumbs felt after the heavy twitter activity of the moments at SXSW. I can’t wait to stress them out again next year as I defend The Taco Thesis once again.

        "excerpt":"[ Have you ever wondered why there is such a large variation in the quality and access to video on the Internet? Consumer Movies on Demand As of 2008, the largest impediment to adoption of wide scale B2B SD and HD video is inter-carrier support for traffic tagging. Traffic tagging has to be honored across carriers to ensure end to end delivery of the data regardless of the interconnection and peering points. Presently, between carriers there is only best effort.  Plainly stated, there is no SLA across carriers. You can do CPA hops through meet-me rooms but that’s just not something that breeds mass adoption. IP transport providers must follow the mobile industry carriers to work together for an “any network any time” model. IPTV vs. Webcasting Webcasting is typically associated with unicast delivery of on demand content to users with typical broadband Internet with standard browsers, media players, on a personal computer.  This could be YouTube, Seesmic, or any of a number of startup companies attempting to give the user generated content revolution eyes and ears. IPTV is typically associated with unicast delivery of on demand movies, multicast delivery of “cable TV”, and special programming such as games and information services to users with very high speed Internet connections such as fiber, ADSL2+, and metro Ethernet that mate to a set top box (STB) that connects to a standard or hidef television set. The STB has a (complex) remote control like that of a satellite or digital cable service but might also include a full size keyboard with a trackball and buttons. Webcasting experiences involve buffering, waiting, and the joy of being able to share content by sending links via email so that others can share in the experience of what one has seen and enjoyed. IPTV is an immediate gratification private experience geared to personal preferences. Webcasting represents a delivery model not currently restrained by access to broadband access control. A company need not provide the Internet to the user to gain the user loyalty. A discussion of so-called Net Neutrality usually comes up at this point in any discussion. IPTV represents significant re-investment by established players that offer control to broadband access. Traditional cable companies must perform a right angle turn to move to IPTV whereas telcos have to increase their control over discreet service levels based on content – i.e. 25Mbps worth of Internet DSL vs. 24Mbps of highdef IPTV content and 1Mbps of Internet Video Conference For unicast video conference between two parties, most people and companies are limited to a best effort service provider such as DSL, cable, or wireless.  Metro Ethernet services have lowered prices for bandwidth and have given a new lease on life for the lower end approach to video conference. The best bet for “slick” continues to be two matched iMac’s with a built in iSight cameras or opt for matching Mini’s and iSights with nice LCD panels. Applications that work for a homogenous approach include iChat and SightSpeed. Other alternatives that are cross platform include iVisit, SiteSpeed, and various Flash based services.  H.323 and SIP variants on video conference are still plagued by NAT traversal and tend to be designed with a hefty technical support in mind. Related to this, Linux for the desktop has come a long way in terms of support for cross platform connections.  There are caveats with Linux are a supported camera and kernel driver as well as a lowest common denominator selection for muxing video and audio between parties. Some consumers will just want to buy a “box” and have things just work.  DLink has a solution that does not require a PC.  This solution is the DLink DVC-1000 Broadband Videophone. Is the Internet a series of tubes? It may sound funny or amusing but the new high speed networks may be tied together in ways we haven’t considered in mainstream discussions.  There is precedent for the use of sewer egress for placement of high capacity optical transport. ","categories": ["NeoNova and Digitel","random"],

        "excerpt":"[ Too Much Text: When I Was Your Age, We Sent Email Tuesday, March 17th at 3:30pm in Room 5A The youngest generation of Internet users have relegated email to the domain of their parents and other “old people”. What are the current technical challenges faced by email that threaten it surviving for another decade of use and facing a decline in adoption by new users? Note: If you can’t attent SxSW this year you can still contribute to the discussion via Facebook, Linkedin, or enjoy the cryptically brief yet oddly alluring slide deck prepared in advance of this major media event. Too Much Text View more presentations from Jay Cuthrell Note: This talk can be rated (registration required). Disclaimer:  Here be dragons draft copy! Abstract When I attended SXSW Interactive in 2008 one of the things I noticed is how little email was used at the conference.  By the time email was typed up and sent out, it was little more than reference material better served and accessible on a website.       Email is now an asymmetric relic.         Email is reserved for copies of your confirmations.         Email is a hurdle to be avoided if possible.   Detail Or, is email really that bad? It’s 2008 and SXSW Interactive is a fairly technical conference.  As expected, everyone had a mobile device capable of Internet access.  A few folks had laptops but most were on an iPhone, Blackberry, or using SMS on their mobile phone du jour.  Twitter adoption was high for the period I was there.  You might have heard about Twitter lately.  Maybe. :smile: But back to email… I checked back to see what email was for my personally that partial week.       I didn’t really get any that was critical to my day to day activities.  Partly because the office knew I was out and at a conference – but mostly because nobody at the conference really dropped phrases like “I will send you an email”.         We handed out business cards.  That seemed archaic to me actually but quaint.  Most of the cards had an email address, phone, etc… but things like instant message or Twitter handles were more common or considered a better way to reach.         Email actually started up the day after the conference.  I guess that was when people started reading their cards and had some downtime.   One thing that stood out for me was this:  email has a personal and time attentive association for many of these people.  It was as if email was what prior generations would consider to be the thank you note or the hand written note — and for some it has become the equivalent of a heart felt hand written letter on fine parchment. Wait!  It’s an email! (I say this in a 36 year old voice) Social patterns aside, email is many things, but it is commonly associated with what is wrong with it: spam and email itself Wait?  Email is a problem itself?  We’ll come back that that. First, let’s look at spam. “Did you get my email” is typically followed with “check your spam folder” and a reply such as “just TXT it to me so that I’ll have it” which makes me think that you a lot of folks feel email is the paper bill you have sitting on the TV stand under the rest of the junk mail from your local post office box. [ The problem email itself has is that even if it isn’t spam to the recipient it is probably battling for the recipient’s attention.  The lowly heart felt email or important email is commingled with far too many other messages in the inbox. There are a whole flood of philosophies and movements to help people deal with their Inbox and the bloat from the pile up it represents.  So, email itself has problems. [ Yet, there are established groups that live for email and the fight against spam.  I’ve been part of those groups to varying degrees for over a decade. It makes me wonder: Am I helping protect a protocol destined for the same fate as GOPHER? As with anything of value there are wars fought over it. With email there is a spy vs spy war raging since the first opportunist could open an email client. This is the war of spammer vs. mail service administrators and email service providers. So, if email has increasingly less and less value – what is it that is so coveted and what is it that is so worthy of being protected for this war to continue? Tarpit, Blacklists, greylists, heuristics, Bayesian filters, regular expression alchemy, SPF, DomainKeys, Sender ID, DCC, hashes, challenge-response, and the list very likely goes on and on.  For each remedy or enhancement to the activity seeking to cater to the needs of the administrator and user there is dark force bent on rendering it obsolete or overpowered. Questions       Why all of this effort to keep email viable as a service that can be taken for granted?         What can be done with email going forward to appeal to new generations of users?         What would make email more valued to everyone that uses email today?         Where is email going to be in the next 5 to 10 years?         When will email and spam conflict be resolved?

        "excerpt":"[ Pat Phelan ask if the experts of social media, well… matter.  Do they matter for a given business?  Do they matter in general? One of the named experts is Jeremiah Owyang and I only know of Jeremiah Owyang because of the world shaking and deeply altering historical signifiance of the Exxon Twitter Crisis of August 2008 (I’m only slightly kidding). The comments on Pat’s post are lively.  I was inclined to comment but mine was moderated so I elected to blow of the dust here and try an actual post for the first time in many months. I even referenced one of the prior comments by calling out one name from the comment thread in particular via the use of  “@name”. (See? I used a @ in front of a name because that is how social media works and surely I’ve created some monetary construct by doing so and there is probably a social media expert that can break down the deep global impact of using the @ as a way to reference the dance hall sized conversation area that is the un-threaded social media destinations — yes, this is a tongue in cheek example of what “experts” provide) One of the areas that mobile wireless companies and telecom are concerned with is the not so surreptitious land grab for social connections — more commonly called “the network”. Another area is regulatory maneuvering since communications are an interesting path to deal in CPNI and how such CPNI is leveraged. For the vision and big picture I’d look to analysis of calling and texting patterns for the true size of a social network vs. the opining of someone that has no clue where financial patterns emerge in handsets, carriers, MVNO’s, etc… even geniuses get mobile wireless trends wrong. Newly minted experts in “duh” probably won’t impact the bottom line either. I’d liken this to a debate between the value of a historian vs. a futurist to the road map and efficacy of a business and its financial model. [ What so few experts in social media seem to articulate while they are diligently describing the nuances of short hand and new ways of using a given tool is questions like: 1) What and how does the operator make more money or make the customer relationship more resilient to competitive attack using social media techniques and how is this ROI tracked or proofed? 2) What is a reasonable growth metric for net new accounts when releasing or applying social media against a line of business or a high margin feature in terms of demand generation? 3) What percentage of my existing customer base is making use of a social media platform already and what is the total costing for my global support organization to add another element outside of call centers, web/email ticketing systems, and internal tool sets that link CRM in a regulatory compliant manner? Those are just three off the cuff questions that matter. Beyond that, all I seem to read is of the form: “[X Service] is neat. You should be on it. Here’s a random example with no bearing on your business model. If you aren’t on [X Service] you are missing out. Please come visit my panel on [X Service] at the [X Convention/Conference] that also has no bearing on your business model.” Maybe I’m just reading the wrong folks.  Or, maybe the noise is so high now that I’m losing interest and/or hope of finding commentary that shifts away from the pumping of the person or tool du jour. Please, someone knock me down with some examples to the contrary. ","categories": ["NeoNova and Digitel","telecom"],

CSO’s and those tasked with corporate governance in areas related to risk may well have to bury their heads in the sand as the next wave of qualified candidates enter the work force. Additionally, it will become apparent that this is a similar concern that was echoed as corporations that shunned the web are curiously those that did not evolve as rapidly in harnessing the technology for business ends. Think back to your first experience working inside or for a company that used draconian proxies to limit access to emerging Internet technology. Next, pull up that company and contrast it to their competition and see if the policy might have something to do with their position in the market today. There is also an argument for claiming your company namespace in those areas relevant to business. At a minimum you should have a Plaxo group, Linkedin group, NING, Twitter, etc. that secures that should your positions or views change later on as the new worker asks where -you- are in the mix.

        "excerpt":"After listening to a podcast rant on the topic of the blog / web / Internet with terms like signal, noise, and other histrionics typically reserved for the stage I felt that familiar urge to capture some quick thoughts. Those on the podcast are not terribly youthful and could easily classify as sages, elders, or at worst – subject matter experts.  They are certainly not in a position to say they have not seen this before.  We all have seen this before as we emerge from our first collective social experience tied to a place, grouping, or special interest.   Scenario:  This place was really cool before [insert influx type] showed up and ruined it. Such wonder from these parties on the podcast made me wonder if such an animal (research paper) exists with a title such as:   Abstract: A historical treatment of emerging or vanguard users on a platform and the inflection when mass markets are able to access that same platform is presented and applied against the backdrop of 20 years of Internet technology paradigm shift. [ Personally, I immediately think of things like Usenet.  I think of FTP sites.  I think of the pre-WWW days and the ways email has been altered over the course of the past ~20 years.  But mostly, I think that the same record is playing softly as an mp3 and that there are still those clutching for life to their wax, 8 track tapes, cassette tapes, compact discs, mini discs, and other associated media formats gone by.  As the holidays approach, is it any wonder the ubiquitous drum set under the tree has modernized as well? It’s a sure bet that just as I considered K-Tel one of the ways to tell that a given media would be going by the wayside.  “K-tel presents” was the harbinger of doom to tapes at least.  What we see is the collection of a moment in time that makes sense for then and afterward it might be so much historic kitsch. Consider this: Do you really care about the ruminations on some random Internet company from a year ago that went out of business?  Does it matter?  Did it at the time?  Does it now?  Will it in the future?  Is link rot really so bad? We’re not always presiding at the creation of art and human artifacts to be that must be preserved for all time.  Indeed, the waste basket of collected wisdom of crowds dumped into a web sizzle bulletin board might not formulate world peace, nirvana, and the next big thing.  Let’s agree to let things go away that go away and let the passions of those that wish to preserve take the collector or archivist activity to a logical conclusion. Or, put simply, do you really want to hear all the fumblings of guitar lessons 20 years before the guitar god penned and played live before the audience?  Really? Coming back to this notion of the formats and precursors that pave the way is a legitmate history to account for but saving it all for posterity might not be.  I have to wonder how Blue-Ray and microformat blog will alter what we think of the DVD and the blog in another 10 years.   As I reflect on that podcast, it does seem that the masses are becoming ever enabled to comment and create and those wax clutching bloggers are noticing. Home recording was revolutionary.  As a song I heard recently puts it, there is something magical to a time where sitting in front of the stereo waiting for the FM station to cut to the track pushed up the adrenaline just as you release the pause button on the deck.   Nowadays, with blog heavy lifting technology moved to easier to disseminate methods and means – everyone, and I mean everyone, can play in these reindeer games. It just seems that trolls can take their FM vignettes on cassette tape and blare them through a 400W stereo replete with sub woofers and the boom boxes of these modern times.  Yes, the troll for attention.  The troll for look at me.  The troll for our times that endures. As to ruining things, the troll emergence is going to be a part of any open system style platform. It’s a tax paid of sorts. The difference is how the troll element is managed as noise or where it is allowed to surface. Generally, “don’t feed the trolls” would still apply. Or, Balkanize, Rinse, Repeat ad infinitum. Moderating is something of an art form.  For as effective as filtering might be on a personal and subscription level, it is still the spam and SEO black hat result set you run into on otherwise benign queries.  SEO and the gaming of the machine for search ranking is passive aggressive trolling.  You want higher?  You put in the work to inject yourself at the top or into the conversation. The trolling most people seem to center on is the troll that seeks to engage or pick fights.  Sure.  That kind of troll activity is there and it will always be there. My concern is with the trolling that comes from wider audience participation that degenerates into ruining the party for everyone.  My concern is not so much with the troll per se but the other members of the audience.  It might sound odd but, if everyone ignored it the troll wouldn’t go away but the troll would become noise that can be ignored.  Ignored might be the filter.  Ignored might just be conditioning to not notice as much.  Ignored might be innovation of the next revolution in services delivered from the Internet. If and when the trolls come – and they always will – the nimble designs of tomorrow need to always facilitate the VIP room, the ability to screen at the door, the ability to bring exclusivity to the place others converge.  Moderation in all things might become part of the formula but not in the Nietzsche way. Imagine a place that was cool.  Why is it was?  Why isn’t it now?  Did you grow out of it or did it truly meet ruin at the hands of others that fundamentally changed everything you valued? In the end, the trolls will only show up when there is an audience for them to interrupt or seeking to interact.  Drama oriented TV shows with manufactured fights, bleeped dialog, and outrageous actions involving chairs flying through the air have enjoyed high ratings for many years.  What makes the Internet so special as to mystically avoid this?  Just as you can change channels – you can click elsewhere.  Just as you can turn off the TV, you can go hide in a cave perhaps. As for the trolls, why not let them be?  Imagine invisible people wearing brightly colored LED blinking jackets carrying boom boxes blaring music and screaming at the tops of their lungs.  Now imagine that same cool place and the ability to opt-in to seeing those that would have ruined it. Squelch the surroundings so that only the things you care about are there in front of you. Squelch will make sure the cool is preserved until you grow weary of it, or the cool grows weary of you. I’ve turned off my TV.  It’s just too cool for me these days.  I’ll be on the Internet for a little while longer.  I think. ","categories": ["NeoNova and Digitel","random"],

You might have heard about Twitter lately.  Maybe. :smile: But back to email… I checked back to see what email was for my personally that partial week.       I didn’t really get any that was critical to my day to day activities.  Partly because the office knew I was out and at a conference – but mostly because nobody at the conference really dropped phrases like “I will send you an email”.         We handed out business cards.  That seemed archaic to me actually but quaint.  Most of the cards had an email address, phone, etc… but things like instant message or Twitter handles were more common or considered a better way to reach.         Email actually started up the day after the conference.  I guess that was when people started reading their cards and had some downtime.   One thing that stood out for me was this:  email has a personal and time attentive association for many of these people.  It was as if email was what prior generations would consider to be the thank you note or the hand written note — and for some it has become the equivalent of a heart felt hand written letter on fine parchment.[Wait!  It’s an email! (I say this in a 36 year old voice) Social patterns aside, email is many things, but it is commonly associated with what is wrong with it: spam and email itself Wait?  Email is a problem itself?  We’ll come back that that. First, let’s look at spam. “Did you get my email” is typically followed with “check your spam folder” and a reply such as “just TXT it to me so that I’ll have it” which makes me think that you a lot of folks feel email is the paper bill you have sitting on the TV stand under the rest of the junk mail from your local post office box. [ The problem email itself has is that even if it isn’t spam to the recipient it is probably battling for the recipient’s attention.  The lowly heart felt email or important email is commingled with far too many other messages in the inbox. There are a whole flood of philosophies and movements to help people deal with their Inbox and the bloat from the pile up it represents.  So, email itself has problems. [ Yet, there are established groups that live for email and the fight against spam.  I’ve been part of those groups to varying degrees for over a decade. It makes me wonder: Am I helping protect a protocol destined for the same fate as GOPHER? As with anything of value there are wars fought over it. With email there is a spy vs spy war raging since the first opportunist could open an email client. This is the war of spammer vs. mail service administrators and email service providers. So, if email has increasingly less and less value – what is it that is so coveted and what is it that is so worthy of being protected for this war to continue? Tarpit, Blacklists, greylists, heuristics, Bayesian filters, regular expression alchemy, SPF, DomainKeys, Sender ID, DCC, hashes, challenge-response, and the list very likely goes on and on.  For each remedy or enhancement to the activity seeking to cater to the needs of the administrator and user there is dark force bent on rendering it obsolete or overpowered. Questions       Why all of this effort to keep email viable as a service that can be taken for granted?         What can be done with email going forward to appeal to new generations of users?         What would make email more valued to everyone that uses email today?         Where is email going to be in the next 5 to 10 years?         When will email and spam conflict be resolved?

        "title": "Raising the bar #TC50 style",
        "excerpt":" Let’s get this out of the way:  TechCrunch50 2009 is what I think of when I think of the term “raising the bar”. Ignoring for a moment the +130 startup companies, the sheer spectacle of being in the thick of the most covered and insular luminaries in the trade, the insanely great demos, the free cupcakes, baseball bats, and bathrooms like those found in the movie Trainspotting — yes ignore all of that. Instead, focus on this fact: Everyone seated in the audience at tables had dedicated individual 100Mbps full duplex Ethernet drops running to them in addition their own power strip.  Everyone had rock solid WiFi connection picking up their iPhone and other connection hungry pocket device or those with laptops not wanting to drink from the sweet vine of wired Ethernet.  Yes.  That’s right.  Everyone. Yes. That’s right. Hundreds of Ethernet drops, AP’s, and what reflects meticulous planning and attention to detail.  Oh, and there was no skimping on the speed either.  Care to guess what this might have cost? (Leave a comment below…) You see, I attend a lot of tech conferences that are telecom and technology focused.  Sometimes I speak at them on panels or alone on a stage.  I’ve worked a bunch of them too.  I’ve done trade show booths, Internet email kiosks, hotspots – all that.  To get that kind of thing to work I’ve had to encounter venue exclusive data services, outsourced venue data services, Ethernet of every flavor and hiccup prone switching fabric imaginable, etc… heck, even ISDN – and that goes back to 1997 for Internet World in NYC.  And the one universal fact concerning Internet access at trade events is that it typically sucks.  That’s a technical term by the way.  Feel free to drop it in conversations with network engineers. As such, when a conference delivers the absolute best Internet experience I’ve ever had this year [1] and years prior – I have to give major props: The TechCrunch50 team delivered that experience.  They picked an outstanding vendor solution service mix and the delivery was flawless. You see, it wasn’t just the speed or the way it was done.  It was the way it was handled from end to end, soup to nuts, cradle to grave.  Operational excellence.  Yes, the Internet service was so over the top that I can only relay it best with an anecdote.   Day 1 of TC50 was amazing and as a working consultant I found myself using the time between stage changes to work on client needs.  When Day 2 of TC50 arrived I was excited to have this flexibility as well.  Imagine my horror when I noticed my gateway was not responding.  Compounding this horror, the fearful popup of another machine MAC address appearing to already have my DHCP assigned IP address.       No worries.  One of the numerous floor IT experts came over when I raised my hand.  He whipped out his LAN tester and determined the switch had cycled power and disconnected my row before my lease expired.  He fixed this within 3 minutes.  I unplugged, plugged back in again – and all was right in the world of connectivity.  This happened again 10 minutes later – undaunted the same man in black came over and performed a similar set of steps and promised “this won’t happen again”.  True to his word, the connection was perfect for the remainder of the conference.    For every tech conference that I attend from this point forward, TechCrunch50 is “raising the bar” of expectations  on Internet connectivity, desktop and floor support, as well as generally just going 100% all out with no apologies or reservations. Kudos I say.  Kudos!! So which tech event or trade show is going to top TechCrunch50?   Any takers? Update: Links and logos added to vendors of merit [1] Indeed, SxSW 2009 is a close second for the BlogHaus (SxSW TechSet Blogger Lounge) selection of Time Warner Business services and slightly more spartan Ethernet drops and power strip availability [ ","categories": ["Consulting Days","random"],

        "excerpt":"Microsoft’s Three Screens Get Cloudy [ What happens when Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer outlines a vision of “three screens and a cloud”? People get interested. However, interest is quickly tempered in the wake of T-Mobile Sidekick data loss from the cloud – a Microsoft cloud.  The implication is a reminder of the importance of getting things right in a silo or a cloud. The rapidly growing space of enabling cloud technology companies and self proclaimed cloud based service providers will feel this. Put another way? Oh the pain. Microsoft acquisitions need not be limited to being a Microsoft shop. This is especially true when considering the managed services companies digested by Microsoft so far such as Hotmail and Jump Networks. Although Danger’s hiptop Service Delivery Engine (SDE) may not be based on Microsoft products and technology the fallout from being associated with a preferred and seasoned hosting platform for mobile operators will sting Microsoft.  A reasonable question might be how does Microsoft reach out to mobile operators in the wake of such a high profile data loss? Early job postings from Danger, Inc. would indicate that much of the Danger back office was not Microsoft based.  Yet, it is not as if Microsoft can point a finger at another company in this matter.  Even if migrations to enable greater use of Microsoft technology were even pertinent in the case of this high profile data loss there is no way to save face here. Simply put, this is a high profile loss of data in the fastest growing market known: mobile.  The injection of this being a cloud issue just amplifies the issue. Nothing more. Nothing less. Indeed, all of this cloud discussion may become fodder for Oracle in certain areas. Yes, Larry Ellison will have a few more minutes of material in his cloud computing standup routine. While taking a shot at Microsoft might be tempting right now, until the rumors become a root cause analysis it is probably wise for competitors to measure words carefully.  As a market, cloud aligned companies would do well to learn from established service provider history associated with data loss. Expect Google, Salesforce, and managed service providers to approach this data loss topic with greater emphasis on data portability, user education, and highlighting the importance of personal data protection best practices.  The usual fallout and market grab for hard media copies (CD/DVD/etc.) as a premium service add will likely appear as well. That said, don’t expect a pile on for Microsoft. Instead, expect greater scrutiny on companies like Amazon, AOL, Comcast (Plaxo), Facebook, and Yahoo regarding their own policies on data ownership and the rights of consumers and businesses to maintain copies of data entrusted to the cloud.

        "excerpt":"Let’s not mince words: Cisco sells routers. Cisco sells a great many IP things but you’ve probably heard: Cisco sells routers. While Cisco has a massive portfolio of solutions and an M&amp;A; trail that would make any MBA blush, the Starent deal is straight pool. [ Mobile core in the side pocket. Much of the analysis so far has been lacking in examination of the longer game that mobile represents. Like straight pool, the mobile market and the prized core network that will connect it all form the basis of a longer game. Equally important to note is the mobile market as a world market and not one limited to North America. Mobile is about world wide growth and capturing the larger mind share of those taking heat as apologists and those wishing to innovate around the competition. Just take one look at the CTO of AT&amp;T; becoming an apologist and you quickly realize this isn’t a knee jerk upgrade path for mobile carriers. It’s not as if sticking in bigger boxes and adding bigger circuits now will solve the problems (perceived or otherwise) for everyone other than Verizon. That all takes time. Recall the AOL and Steve Case commercials back in the days of dialup ISP? The similarities are stark. We’ve seen Navini trotted out as an example of Cisco turning away from WiMAX. What? This is mixing up things in terms of the routing capability and the access layer capability of wireless systems. It’s confusion for those that seek to understand how these companies, boxes, and bits ultimately fit together. Starent gives Cisco instant access to the routing concerns, pains, hopes, dreams, desires, and roadmap expectations that will translate into a sales pipeline in mobile. More importantly, Cisco takes the Starent ball off the pool table. [ While Juniper is mentioned, it is debatable that they have any play left outside of a piecemeal strategy such as putting together a wicked combination shot:       2G/3G optimization for 2G/3G on PDH via Force10 (Turin)         Purpose build packet optical transport via Cyan Optics         any number of applications or DPI enhancements for walled garden and billing integration platforms   In short, a much riskier shot to pull off cleanly… without scratching. Cisco has called their shot and will continue to control the pool table until they foul. While it might be tempting to call it evil… or stifling innovation… it’s not dirty pool. It just means that the game continues in the series of games. ","categories": ["Consulting Days","random"],

        "title": "Social Telecom",
        "excerpt":"_Note: Welcome to Friday Fudge #1 of hopefully many to come. _ [ About a year ago I spoke in front of the Atlanta Telecom Professionals (ATP) audience on the topic of social media and telecommunications.  It was a great crowd. I was also afforded a glass of Scotch. Trust me when I say the crowd was great regardless of the Scotch I had consumed as the panel pulled together.  It doesn’t get much more telecom focused than the  group of folks assembled that evening. The panel included me. Oh, and AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast… oh wait… Comcast ducked out on the panel.  More on that later. I was on the panel to represent the outsider.  I wasn’t a carrier.  I wasn’t a wireless operator with spectrum, lobbying forces, and a war chest.  I was just a person lucky enough to know folks that knew folks that might enjoy my specific brand of insight and humor on the stage. As I sat in front of the assembled group with the titans of telecom to my right and to my left I remarked to my fellow panelists that I’d be putting my favorite devices in front of me.  To my left I placed my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry International Edition and to my right I placed my AT&amp;T Wireless iPhone 3G. One of the benefits of Comcast not showing up was that we could talk about them.  Good times.  Good times. Anyhow… Before I arrived for the panel I jotted down some notes.  I had some ideas that I really wanted to throw out there and see if anyone grabbed on to what I was saying.  You never know how that approach will work out since panels are often driven by the need for consensus and keeping things on a timeline.  Often, the panel is driven quickly to Q&amp;A. The question for telecom is how well has the social toolset served them and when will it serve them or their subscribers – and can this be a relationship as social between the cold exterior of a conglomerate media machine and the monetized unique personal attribute collection formerly known as a subscriber. Looking back a year later, here are my notes – not predictions but my own reflections and the observations of others about the connections made possible by what was happening in social software spaces and how this might be applied to telecom or affect telecom: Base decisions on most recent parallel events vs. previous events. I was imagining a screen that tracked keywords in a disposition code format of lifestream updates for the CIDR blocks known to the telecom that represent a given area that was referenced against weather patterns to provide a living view of plant.   Sure, it’s something for the big screen in a NOC.  But does it have to be?  Couldn’t these interfaces be nimble enough for the important items to bubble up to a CSR view or a executive manager view? The notion of stratification by CLLI codes would be a good example. Basically, some variety of feedback loop with a base station or aggregation node view is important. i.e. subscribers being vocal (or silent) in a localized view format You want to see that a lull or non-characteristic gap in updates for a geocode set turned out to be a plant dip.  All of this would play back against a lower sub screen view of the network as a whole to determine if there is a degradation or other anomaly not presently identified and tracked adequately. This could be two users in the same CIDR block where an update arrives via third party API to talk to an account or rep much in the same way power outages attempt to use callerid to fast track tickets for outages. Distributed network monitoring and SLA based on channel mix bundle for customer class action crediting for outages This might have some meat to it.  After discussing this amongst some others in the same general field I am in the consensus was “yeah, why not”.  In general this would form the basis of an ad-hoc class action customer experience fee recovery system.   Assuming the AUP/ToS did not preclude a resident agent/process with this goal in mind (and really, that’s not the point) one could feed back a quasi-SLA to residential tiers of service.  This is part of my larger focus on the shift to a truly utility approach to granular billing if “the cap” ever makes it out of the ham fisted iterations we’ve seen so far. XMPP of the customer experience as a sparkline This was pretty simple in that seeing a lot of chatter about your brand from accounts known to talk about you might be an interesting data point for marketing groups and operations teams.  Fake meme and trending notwithstanding. :smile: Unprecedented access to correlate and improve plant and service delivery One idea was to make a simple mailto link in a follow up email with five options that generate updates to social networks indicating your level of satisfaction with the provider.  Since the panel, the API options have exploded for gaining feedback including the ubiquitous click here to share on Facebook and prefab Twitter responses. Just as there are sites the give a shortcut to bypass inane IVR there is Twitter and Getsatisfaction and Uservoice or even Atlanta’s own Skribit A frustrated subscriber wants to get issues resolved.  It’s very simple.   The subscribers might not know what a back channel is but they would probably call or interact if they could update from a SMS to their provider when the broadband is out – something as simple as the word “down” or “not working” where the provider is digesting streams is one thing but the goal here is Digg for Down and Outage situations. i.e. I’m having this issue – with 10-100 subscribers saying “me too” Remember, a growing number of subscribers have multiple networks at their disposal.  Just like the legacy view is “call if you have a problem” a new view is Twitter updates, smartphone access, etc.  So, being down doesn’t mean being silent. [As with all these new social tools for gathering and refining feedback, the critical step is to test and think about how obtuse the tools are implemented.  Don’t make extra work. That just frustrates the subscriber even more. DSL Reports will move beyond a bulletin board of threaded discussion to a real time mediation of issues and “me too” This is the notion that subscribers will form pools of affinity and the Fan pages that will not be a scripted corporate controlled medium.  It may not be the most exciting news story but for a provider – this is shaking in your boots level technology – but only for the providers that choose not to participate and let the chips fall.   I’m seeing this happen as DSL Reports refines their hierarchy (shades of Usenet?) for discussions.  When I was thinking about this originally things like Stack Overflow came to mind. Again, this is about regular subscribers. So, the tin ears have to be small ones for any UI/UX approach. The classic oversubscription on plant in favor of highly asymmetric links to Internet egress will be challenged as publish and cloud applications push the envelope I’ve repeatedly said that asymmetric broadband is going to be a thing of the past.  We have applications that stream updates in realtime more now than the year prior with no easing to the trend.  For every optimized code loop the software world throws into production, a new nimble startup will figure out a new payload to push the limits.  And in that push — the upload will be as critical as the download.  The new downstream is the upstream.   [that are making that pull and extend experience with gaming consoles. What we might still call _ TV’s _ are going to be shipping in the wake of CES with ever increasing symmetric communication.  Skype (big TV brands) or something like a TinyChat (thinking Walmart brand TV’s) is going to push against the notion that an ADSL link or the pitiful cable modem package of many down and few up is acceptable. The application mix and managed routers will evolve to WAAS like features that improve branch to branch experience I wasn’t specifically calling out Cisco solutions but this was something I obviously had in mind.  At work, everything you experience with broadband at home is a reasonable (if not double) expectation for business class services at a job site.  Yet, business class services often are slower in areas where higher speed residential broadband is available.   During the panel, things like cloud computing and low latency or high throughput applications came up as reasons why the business class expectations will change.  IP Centrex phone services based on VoIP with a SIP trunks model is growing at a faster pace now due to economic benefits but it is unclear that the connectivity has kept pace. That said, the point of bringing up Cisco’s role in this was to point out that the same topology and traffic management concerns of larger enterprises is now being packed into the form factor of a common Cisco ISR and would likely become a fire and forget feature to address chatty and high overhead protocols.  The availability of such technology will mean a lot to the small remote office connected to a regional office.  The natural conclusion is to see this played back in subscriber CPE. Putting the intelligence in endpoints is the key to seeing benefits overall.  Again, it’s about pushing the envelope with what social oriented technology brings as a demand. VoIP and general voice costs will continue a race to zero Does this really come as a shock? It got a laugh of course.   What this really means longer term is that all providers have to get into a higher value service. Since the panel there have been any number of big things happen in this area from Google Voice to all you can eat packages. The important point is that there are still challenges to how providers plan to fund initiatives and relying upon the legacy service model or product is flawed thinking. Flawed might not be the right term but in the absence of seeing Skype embedded in more places more of the time there is a closing window on the POTS and circuit-switched world. Social services will deprecate younger buyer concern for uptime and availability premium as part of lowered expectations from growing up mobile I.e. All providers suck [This was the concept of how mobile phone call quality and Twitter Fail Whale and cryptic web errors gained a fever pitch status with younger users.  In fact, the older users see this as well but they remember when things like uptime and availability meant something and how a land line call really did sound better.   The term users is also key.  Subscribers vs. users is a word choice I try to be careful with in panel settings.  Generally speaking, the provider has to handle the customer and the manner in which a designation is applies tells a lot about the background and direction of a service and company as a whole. When you think about a concept like price elasticity, you have to wonder about lock in as a viable model when the youth market has been raised to see fads come and go online and in communications. What happens when AT&amp;T becomes a Friendster to a new Facebook? Remember, it’s not always going to be an absolute assumption that the bigger players win.  The FCC tremblings and rumblings even before the panel indicated things might just change (for once) in how we think of a nimble operator or service provider. Younger consumers will assume that the provider knows more about them and will be less tolerant of flawed CRM In the face of privacy and how providers treat CPNI, there is a desire to opt on either the side of flat out ignorance or the Sprint Now Network commercial.  Some might view this as a all or none proposition.  So, which is it?  Full on unfettered use of DPI with tremors of conflict in other nations quashed and monitoring in a dystopian future… or not so evil aggregation of personalized trends to give you a better service?   Example: Twitter’s very own @comcastcares As I was saying at the start, Comcast ducked out on the panel.  This was unfortunate because I actually think they were to be commended for their role in adopting a back channel to augment their existing channels of communication with the subscribers.   Comcast has issues.  The difference now is all their subscribers flock somewhere other than a support line to complain. If you are a service provider, expect this is happening in your subscriber base as well.  In fact, bank on it. One thing to take away though is the almost lancing effect @comcastcares has on the pressure of a subscriber issue.  In general, if the broadband is down one might wonder how you reach them – simple – Twitter is a backchannel available through just about any mobile device with a data plan or even SMS Service providers: your suck cannot hide [and as a perfect example of the new type of subscriber all service providers will have to contend with now: power subscribers   The power subscriber is the service provider equivalent of what Enterprise 2.0 faces with their own power users.  Enterprise and service provider are still vastly different worlds, so I think it is important to highlight the differences since there is a distinct economic associate for subscribers.  The subscriber pays for and expects a service level. For a power subscriber to take note of an issue is the moment a service provider has to take note as well.  It’s not just the fact that service providers find themselves providing connectivity or a service used by industry pundits.  It’s more than that.  It’s the fact that those pundits are connected with wider audiences that can quickly and efficiently compare notes on a provider in much lower latency ways than ever before. If there is a service blip, people will know. In there is a service issue or quirk, people will know. A power subscriber like MG Siegler is an example of someone that has kept track of their issues and has a long memory.  He is not alone.  His series of articles on AT&amp;T and iPhone issues were and are relentless.  When his coverage and TechCrunch editor Mike Arrington coverage becomes content placed in syndication on the Washington Post, watch out folks. The FCC might just notice. What this translates to for service providers that have come to be regarded as lethargic is simple: if you have problems, the new social tools available will amplify and coordinate the uprising from your subscriber base locally, regionally, nationally, and perhaps internationally.  If you get picked up by tech press for having issues, it is a very short walk to the end of the mainstream press channel. So, in the end, what social telecom might really mean is a implicit expectation from subscribers (users) of a service that works well almost all of the time. The keys to achieving this will involve using the same technologies within the service provider that their own subscribers are using outside the service or on the very same service itself.

        "excerpt":"Note: Welcome to Friday Fudge #2 of hopefully many to come.  You’ve heard of going Google. Well, I’ve gone Google.  Yes.  Color Nicholas gone. In fact, I’ve been using Google Apps since late 2006. Granted, I’m not representative of a multinational corporation with tens of thousands of seats.  One of the criticisms of hosted applications is how they are just not suited to larger shops that require high levels of uptime.  Often you hear these are high touch IT environments. Okay, fair enough. I invested in Google Apps Premier Edition and have spoken on the phone with the Google Apps support team a total of three times during that period.  Yes, during brief outages.  You can do the math on how many nines of uptime that is pretty quickly. Here’s one such example: The Phone Support Experience. In this instance, an outage was isolated only the web (Gmail) that was having an issue.  I was using IMAP with no issues.  As a matter of practice, I sync my Google Apps via IMAP as well.  This gives me the most flexibility and I have a backup stored that I can replicate to other storage media elsewhere for backup and archival.  The same goes for Calendars, Contacts, etc… it’s all good for the most part. [ As for the other two issues, those were related to importing MS Word and Powerpoint files in the Documents area – each issue was resolved quickly.  Frustrating at the time?  Yes. That said, when I’ve been assured of solid Internet connectivity at conferences, I’ve presented from Google Docs for slide decks to prove my points on cloud concepts. Yes, I keep a thumb drive copy in my pocket. Coming from a telecom/ISP/hosting background, my standards are very high.  Yet for the price of the seat they offer and the expanding features added over time, it’s a solid choice. For now. [is another solution where I expect to see expanded use over time for maximum hybrid functionality and another truncheon in the bewildering array of options for the silo averse IT world. In short, I’m sold. Here’s the thing though… I’ve also also hosted my website/email/etc… at various web hosting shops, my own server in company colocation (eat your own dog food / drink your own champagne), hosted at home using a DynDNS approach, as well as taking it all down, redirecting it to lifestreaming services, and most recently… the cloud.  Just not a Google cloud for everything. Yet. These migrations were also back and forth, mix and match, and not an either or proposition.  That’s the problem you run into sometimes with new technology. Many folks assume different solutions cannot operate in tandem or as a hybrid. [to mix and match what makes sense.  The next big thing is taking this all to the cloud. Okay, enough about the box that sat next to the desktop… Let’s get back to the desktop [Again – there is room for more than one approach.  The market is massive for this approach.  In the same way that web hosting became regarded as something you rarely do “in house” so too will other applications come to be regarded.  Partly, this will be due to the notion of who is expected to interact and what level of desktop support and connectivity is standard. If Microsoft came out with an amazing way to avoid dealing with a silo of data that was fragile or easily lost – I’d move that way.  In reality, the company behind the solution is not nearly as important as the promise of the solution.  Only when you consider the longevity of the data you care about is the reputation or company.  This is why I think the private cloud and federated concepts like Google Wave will be much like the early days of NCSA HTTPd server. [So, while everyone has a short memory window of right now when it comes to the cloud, I remember being at Internet World Fall 1997 in NYC.  I remember how the network computer was going to rule the world. I remember Sun and Oracle as two different companies saying their view was the way it shall be.  IBM begged to differ. How far we’ve come? Marketing will always be ahead of the delivery capabilities of the markets envisioned.  Technology is merely the response to the perceived need. Still, the step function of market desire and market reality gets more shallow with each passing year. ","categories": ["Consulting Days","friday fudge"],

        "title": "The Waiting",
        "excerpt":"_Note: Welcome to Friday Fudge #3 of hopefully many to come._ [… YouTube is difficult to understand as a business model for a lot folks.  Heck, a lot of this Internet stuff is. What’s changed since then?  Not a lot really.  But… Welcome to 2010 and the promise of the ever elusive (illusive?) promise of the P WORD. Or something. Please wait… YouTube profitability for Google is -still- buffering As anyone that remembers the buffering messages associated with early video streaming technology of the 90s will recall, the waiting is the hardest part.  Just like the background colors in the Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers video hint Google’s colorful logo there is finally a hint at YouTube profitability. In June 2009, frustration with waiting for profitability was on the rise and coverage reflected as such.  Indeed, another point of view at this time was to qualify how bad losses might be.  Absent strong guidance from Google, it’s easy to see where analysts would begin to color YouTube differently as a result of that frustration.  To understand the frustration is to understand the limits of traditional modeling in emerging services models with no guidance on where revenues will emerge or the underlying costs to deliver those services. Early in the life of the YouTube acquisition, the revenue assumption was coarsely positioned as “running ads”.  Years later the sources of revenue are as varied as the content one might find on YouTube.  Indeed, the past two years of rapid feature rollouts and development within YouTube showcase and tantalize the scenarios for far more than just  “running ads” to generate revenue:       Full feature length movies         Deep audience analytics         Storage for HD content         Large screen formats         Partner programs for news media         Location based services options   [. Titans of this size have remarkably nimble ways of disrupting assumed models for calculating costs. These are companies not only regarded for their impact on scaling problems but also for the heft of the footprint they place on sourcing avenues.  Indeed, it might be argued that such special cases are the outliers in the sweeping graphs for a given pricing model. So where is the intercept? The speed at which technology platforms are turned over in a scale problem as large as those faced by these Internet titans represents a drastic shift in thinking.  A better assumption might be to envision purchasing patterns in ways that are neither enterprise nor carrier.  In other words, burn your existing models. Instead, a focus should be made on several other aspects:       Location: the case of shared network computing models within multi-use data centers, and novel peering relationships — while the size of the plate is a sensational metric it is more important to consider the mix of business made possible by location selection         Goals: the case of business goals for allocated infrastructure — it is important to remember that a Google vs. Amazon sizing could be close but not applicable in estimates since the business goals are different for each         Multi-use: the case of unique business mixing — these are drastically different companies in terms of how they use their facilities and there is no fit for an enterprise pattern and the presence of a collection of data centers does not create a carrier model.   [on what Apple will do with their planned North Carolina datacenter.  Of note is the fact that as of now, the only thing to do is speculate and assume that this is an excellent location.  That said, no concrete goals or multi-use disclosure has been made by Apple at this time. In conclusion, any model based on enterprise or carrier assumptions (no matter how they are assumed) renders most analyst predictions far from accurate. When approaching the scale and vibrant refresh requirements of the current crop of Internet infrastructure titans, it is best to stick with public financial reporting and avoid reverse engineering of secret sauce costs and wait for the revenue numbers to be shared.

This is great. I mean, now I can watch TV while I watch TV.

        "title": "Airwaves vs Airlines",
        "excerpt":" On my last Delta flight I was not so surprised to see that my upgrade to first class went through.  Since I travel a lot this is, thankfully, pretty common.  What happened next was the stuff of wonder an amazement. When I ordered my Delta Instant Nap in a Plastic Cup; Scotch; the response wasn’t rocks or neat but… Dewars or Glenlivet.  After my mind reset, I went with Glenlivet – neat – and it came served in a glass tumbler. Sometimes you just have to travel to make a face to face meeting happen.  Or do you? If you’ve never participated in a Cisco Telepresence session, don’t worry, you will.  One of the primary drivers for getting into VoIP for Cisco was that it sold an awful lot of these things that required Ethernet ports to plug into and routers to connect all of it together. So, it’s no small wonder that Cisco has pushed hard for video to become part of the way business meets face to face over distances and time frames previously reserved for cross country trek via jumping on planes, trains, and automobiles. As a footnote, my personal experience and peers anecdotal evidence points to this becoming more common and as expected as having a phone.  Cisco has pushed the protocols standard here and there is a likely benefit to be seen from this in 2-3 years.  Couple that with broadband stimulus, greater expectations on service providers, and you’ve got a formula that will have airlines rethinking a lot of things very very quickly. ahem iPad/Laptop/iPhone integrated cameras ahem   [ At the same time, there is a new view of the disconnected nature of travel. Road warriors are not just reading books or nodding off after their plastic cup of Scotch.  Instead, they are staying connected after reaching a “safe” operating altitude by forking over a little bit more than an egg sandwich would cost in coach.  If I see a WiFi sign, I’m going to use it.  I’d expect this pay model to fall away or blend into a package or membership privilege just as the value market segments of hospitality have experienced.   [ Still, the problem with working during a flight is well… it’s just not that comfortable with a laptop unless you are in business class or better.  The cramped quarters of a coach experience and the potential for the girth of a fellow passenger spilling over into your mythical personal space is very real.  Compounding this is the simple fact that even coach has good, bad, worse, and worst seating options.  Additionally, few carriers are competing on service – and that’s an important point.   [ Compared to the airline club experience, the plane workplace is decidedly awful.  Delta Sky Club offers free wireless and wired Internet now. The phones are passable if they work at all and having a DID means you can map this with your own IP Centrex provider or office call leg features.  Else, you are dealing with your mobile and risking Skype if the shared broadband segment is saturated.  That said it is still a much better prospect for getting things done and the self service and full service mix can be nice.   [ One area that isn’t going to cut it with travel is carriers that charge premiums that are not aligned with the customer experience.  When faced with traveling for a face to face meeting and being pinned into a coach seat and risking injury due to worn equipment surfaces vs. going into a soothing Cisco Telepresence experience meeting room… yeah. Game over.   ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"[. It was a blast.  50 startup companies were pitching hard and heavy on the Fox stage.  The weather outside the Fox was bone chilling but everyone inside was warm, fully amped on piping hot coffee, and flying high from the sugar rush of gourmet style donuts.   [Outside the main hall, the demo pit was assembled with table top displays and reps from the startups.  The displays ranged from HUGE to muted to small to… non-existent.  Ah, variety. Oh, and it was streamed. LIVE.   [As with any collection of startup companies numbering in the dozens, much like a variety mix of donuts, some just don’t go over as big as the others.  I had a chance to actually talk with just over 28 of the 50 startups.  Those I didn’t get to talk with were either conspicuously absent from their table top displays… or they were simply working the room and not working the crowd. In fact, some of the ones I’ll mention are ones I don’t even recall seeing at the table tops. Also, as you might expect, there was a peanut gallery. True to form.   [aka TC50.  Let’s just say that TC50 is more an experience than an event and one that is hard to envision replicating without significant investment and long term planning. i.e. vision over venue and configuration over convention.  So, I’m loathe to try and attempt anything resembling comparison.  That said, I did capture live event notes and opted for the latest shiny Google Buzz vs. the most successful tool I’ve used to date, FriendFeed.  Next time I’ll be using Google Wave now that there is a public viewing model for this.  As with any event where you seek to take live event notes to the cloud… you better have a solid Interwebs connection.  Sadly, I didn’t for this particular event… so, while Buzz was killed, I lived.   Here are a few selected Buzz notes before my connection died… I came back online later once the SSID land grab had ended and posted from a relatively solid WiFi connection:   This is not as easy as using FriendFeed for note taking. Yet, I’m done with FriendFeed in evaluation if not the community shrapnel. Another thing that impressed me was just how many people traveled to be at Startup Riot.  I was expecting mostly Atlanta based startup companies… wrong!     Q&amp;A session… folks came from as far away as Kentucky apparently. Wow!       CritSend came all the way from Paris??? Wow.   I imagined there would be someone covering the event with clinical precision… and I was not disappointed:   Paul is a frikkin’ machine http://paulstamatiou.com/live-blogging-startup-riot-2010 My favorite quote from the entire event   “All accounting applications suck… we just suck the least” – http://LessAccounting.com And then I realized that the Interwebs for the event wasn’t going to lend to live event notes…   WiFi is problematic…. going to chalk this up to pen and paper. bbiab. [settled down I was able to get online again and it was pretty rock solid from that point forward and I was able to share a few picks.     Okay – here are the companies I found to be interesting in order of reviewing/meeting with them: BeeWellWishes, CoreMotives, CritSend, DoLeaf, DriveSafe, LearnItLive, LessAccounting, Napstay, PawPawMail, Rank’em, Savont, SkyBuyHigh, Softmaxx, and last but not least… Looxii       Best I Wish I Had Thought Of That: ViralPrints   ","categories": ["Consulting Days","friday fudge"],

This was my slide deck….   The Redneck Guide To Silicon Valley View more presentations from Jay Cuthrell. Controlling the mic most melodic was MC Zach Ward (@zachward).  Let’s just say that MC Zach Ward touched us all in ways that ranged from appropriate to slightly more appropriate while exhibiting the grace of a man in tights.  On the assist was the #OurHashTag team keeping it nailed down for all involved.  They even streamed it live and saved it for posterity (my presentation is at the 1:43 mark but watch em all!). The other Ignite presenters were an absolutely amazing bunch and it was an honor to share a stage with them.  They were in no particular order based on my mental notes: [boldly went where no man has gone before… but probably should. And often. Janet Kennedy (@jkennedy93) gave us all pause to think about what a few cents mean and could mean to others. David Millsaps (@eyevariety) of New Raleigh made the case for hitting the books again and thinking about social with that in mind. Jess Commins (@renewabelle) made sure that everyone would think about caulk in ways that make a old man blush and a young man squeal. Henry Copeland (@hc) made sure we all knew that warts can kill startups. Lisa Creech Bledsoe (@glowbird)  rocked the stage and convinced everyone to consider becoming a woman… a boxing woman. Ryan Boyles (@therab) detailed his plans to avoid skateboarding zombies along a post-apocalyptic path on the way to SxSW. Evan Carroll (@evancarroll) explored what happens to your digital self when your real world self ends up in a flower pot. Natasha Crawford (@natashacrawford) convinced us to dip our pens in the home ink instead of the company ink. Jay Dolan (@jaydolan) made the case for shutting the laptop, turning off the iphone, and following dreams instead of avatars. Elizabeth Gardner (@WRALweathergal) humbled everyone attending with her relentless nap-free day serving up the new of localized precipitation and average kinetic energy. Nadia Moffett (@missncusa2010) showed us what it means to change lives by building relationships and being Miss NC! Chris Moody (@cnmoody) highlighted where customer acceptance begins and bias ends in how you form a team of rock stars and the crucial entourage of dumb. Charlotte Moore (@cavaticat) put forth the argument that a five letter word synonym for woman is cylon and there should be a massively multi-muliebrity meeting of minds. Laurie Ruettimann (@lruettimann) finished strong with a hard hitting expose on the intricacies of gaming business social networking sites using tomcat tomfoolery. George Smart (@georgesmartTMH) showed us homes that created by artists for artists in residence and those that host them. Bethany Smith (@bethanyvsmith) opened strong with a second slide that said it all made everyone that followed her question the decks yet to be shared. Dan Wilson (@danwilson) delivered dry humor with a heaping helping of health wisdom and confirmed that 30 minutes is actually 30 minutes while confirming he should be run for State Treasurer.

My first time presenting at Ignite         My first “contributing blogger” articles for an industry blog         My first article for an industry publication (still haven’t mastered how to link to a magazine…. hmmm)   So, as someone that hit the reset button at one point… this is going to be interesting. Why?  I’ll tell you… First, I think I finally have something to share.  It isn’t that what I wrote before was anything that would shift the hearts and minds of the world.  It also isn’t that what I expect to lay down here will do that either.  However, I’ve learned that there is a market for just about everything.  Hopefully, what I share finds one such market. Second, the way things are going with comments these days tells me that it is more important than ever to bring it back to home turf. Sure, dabble here and there and sign up and try but bring back the good stuff to where it matters.  Even with awesome services like Backtype pulling back my take elsewhere you still run the gamut of how everything is being curated – or not at all. Third, in going back to the intent of Friday Fudge I revisit the following:     …expect one or more of these personas to emerge with varying degrees of aptitude and literary grace…       [ Finally, I’ll let the experts weigh in on this whole blog thing  The whole subscribe thing is really what I like since it comes to me instead of me having to come to it and that really balances out the whole thing if you pull back to look at it from a mildly cosmic point of view.  The blog will aid me as I seek to correlate web server logs for IP addresses tied to comments and one time click through in direct communication that I then match against societally objectionable content websites run by my shell companies and their respective log corpus thereby supplying me with the means to extort those in political office and/or with financial connections that would opt to forgo displacement from the elite facade of their so-called good life.   The first thing I gotta git is one of them thar road ruggedized lappytops with a wireless broadband chipset so that I can mount on back for the roadside diner stops to keep up with my investment portfolio and git commit my latest revisions for the Android app I’ve been dinking around with for the past week.    I’m a bit confused as to how many blogs I can fit on the magazines table next to the waiting chairs.    Blogging means I might start to show up on Techmeme and with any regularity I’ll be quite the ladies magnet.

The blur is a wonderful one filled with more new people than prior years and a cast of familiar faces peppering events by day and night.   Here’s an interview I did with Downloadsquad that summarizes what I’ve seen by Day 3.  Fast forward past the part with some guy named Guy Kawasaki :wink: The new format this year lends to greater emphasis on connecting with others as there are three distinct locations for programming and events.

As of this update there are over 90 participants in the wave and the notes have been augmented by several participants already.

As for AT&amp;T and the iPhone — a very guarded so good so far is coming from a lot of folks here.  I’ve had all my 3G bars on my iPhone but the timeouts and throughput seem to indicate that the backhaul is being saturated during peak gatherings or the specific serving site is simply overwhelmed.  Regardless, my iPhone battery life is drastically improved this year.

More on that later below… First, I’d like to say something to AT&amp;T considering their complete failure last year for SxSW 2009:   [Good job AT&amp;T * Why the * ?  Well, I was able to actually use my iPhone this year. Crazy right?  Yes.  The only issues I had were obviously backhaul related during times where even with prior planning – the provisioning lacked capacity to accept that many people at one time. So, I had full signal for the majority of my stay in the densely packed downtown areas of Austin for SxSW 2010.  While that didn’t mean I was always able to use the network it did mean that my battery life was greatly improved.  I was able to top off at 6pm and have it last until 2am most nights.  Kudos on the signal. I am guessing that asking around greater Austin would bring the same mixed results as last year though since this was an engineered event experience. So, AT&amp;T…. please bring your “A game” to the rest of your “map” and everything will be alright. BTW, it was nice seeing Luke Wilson driving around the CoWs. Okay on to the music and film selections… The following are from my Foursquare notes from ~200 Twitter updates during SxSW.  Oddly enough, my only real use of geolocation “games” during SxSW involved notes of being somewhere for a band.   I was able to catch +35 bands and +5 films.

        "title": "Get off of my cloud",
        "excerpt":"[Note: This is a draft of a longer article I’ll be publishing in an industry journal. There is a series of amusing videos circulating the Internet that feature Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, taking terms like “cloud computing” and “the cloud” to task.  Simply visit your favorite search engine and query “Larry Ellison on cloud computing”. The top hit should be a video of Larry Ellison being, well, Larry Ellsion.  It’s worth spending 3 minutes to watch Ellison talk about “cloud computing” and “the cloud”.  Here’s why… The Cloud? [While Ellison mixes humor and hyperbole regarding “the cloud”, it is also evident that the same man that envisioned a Network Computer almost 15 years ago has strong opinions about what “the cloud” is in reality.  Still, in attempting to define what is and what is not “cloud”, perceptions are quite varied. As any service provider professional knows from network diagrams that depict the Internet, the commonly used clip art will be a “cloud”.  To come back to Ellison’s point, everything that a customer might view as a “cloud” is what a service provider is ultimately going to enable.  That might be shocking to many reading this but indeed you as a service provider are making the “cloud” possible. Yet when a group of non-juggernaut sized service providers assemble at events the perception of “cloud” often brings up names like Google, Amazon, Rackspace, and entities that are not the service providers themselves.  If you ask the same assembly if they can provide a hosted application to their customers you’ll probably hear “Yes” or “Yes, through our hosting partner”. Metaphorically, the precipitation falling from the “cloud” is software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and storage;hardware;communication; as a service (XaaS). So, what is that sets apart “cloud” from what service providers are doing today? Yes, the Cloud. What Google, Amazon, Rackspace, and various large application service providers have proven is that the “cloud” approach of marketing and packaging hosted applications is vigorous and growing rapidly. The “cloud” market is estimated to be in the tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars from a variety of market research firms and economic studies. If you’ve been contacted by a vendor there is a good chance your vendor is using Salesforce.com which has embraced a “cloud” as their own logo. By breaking down what Salesforce.com does, it turns out to be a set of hosted applications running in a data center your vendor has never visited.  Within that data center it is also likely that the servers stacked up in racks connected to high capacity Internet links are “virtualized” servers.  In effect, by calling a particular approach to hosting various applications, the “cloud” was born. Digging deeper, an article roughly a year ago from datacenterknowledge.com indicates that Salesforce.com “cloud” was actually “a single, third-party Web hosting facility located on the west coast of the United States, leased from Equinix, Inc.” .  Next, consider that Google’s “cloud” includes synchronous replication of customer data across  multiple randomized regional data centers located strategically around the globe and you start to see how not all “clouds” are created equal. Making Clouds Today, the most pervasive hosted collaboration application is widely considered to be the humble service known simply as email.  If service providers have offered an email service then a variety of “cloud” has been delivered to subscribers.  The email service may be hosted at the service provider or at a third-party provider somewhere else entirely accessible across the Internet. Another example that is very well understood by service providers is the notion of IP Centrex.  IP Centrex was rebranded as communication as a service (CaaS) and with the advent of application programming interface (API) access it was reclaimed a “cloud” based communications.  Again, it is very likely that then a variety of “cloud” has been delivered to subscribers already. 2010: A Service Provider Odyssey View more presentations from Jay Cuthrell. Four years ago, Billing &amp; OSS (B/OSS) World highlighted the following areas for service providers to pay attention to: IPTV, Mobile TV, FTTP, VoIP, WiMAX, P2P, IMS, ENUM, FMC, and IPv6.  Conspicuously absent from this list is any reference to a “cloud”.  So while “cloud” might not have been on the radar of B/OSS some four years ago, the past two years have seen around 400 articles alone that reference a “cloud”. So, it might be time to consider how a service provider today can get in on this “cloud” business. Clouds Ahead The prior example of providing email and IP Centrex is just a way to view the “cloud” opportunity for a service provider.  Other such opportunities are a relationship away by working with a growing number of partners that have identified the unique position a service provider has in delivering a hosted application. Examples of areas where a “cloud” opportunity presents itself:       Netbooks         Content Delivery Networks         Private Clouds   Netbooks [or Windows 7.  The disk space on netbooks is usually enough to hold an operating system but not much else.  Instead, the operating systems support so-called “cloud” based storage solutions that keep subscriber files and important data backed up somewhere else on the Internet until it is accessed by the netbook. Next, the notion of being able to access this “cloud” sequestered data with a netbook brings to mind the importance of low latency high speed Internet connectivity and where the service provider has to shine: broadband that is delivered with “cloud” applications in mind.  So, the service provider should imagine the following scenario:   “Cloud” storage for files on a netbook are a single hop away from the aggregation of the access layer solution.  From the netbook, to the subscriber CPE, to the gateway for the CPE, to the remote, to the central office, to the rack and right before reaching the Internet — a virtual server within the same rack is providing file storage and safe secured replication for the subscriber files. At no point does the subscriber have to leave the service provider network and cross the Internet to reach those “cloud” files.  Effectively, the files are right down the street.  If the subscriber travels to another town, city, state, or country those files are still accessible over the Internet that comes back to the service provider. As with most opportunities in the “cloud” space, there are already a variety of partners catering to service providers.  The key decision a service provider must make is key to retaining the subscriber relationship by deciding how much they will be delivering for a high quality “cloud” experience.  If the service provider wishes to be best in delivering the connectivity and leave the application stack to another third-party, there are partners ready to take on those challenges. Content Delivery Networks [are the companies that enable how the modern web experience is produced today.  The digital assets you browse, stream, and download online are likely to be delivered from a “cloud”.  CNN.com is an example of this approach whereby the traffic to deliver a web site is broken up into numerous web servers all across the Internet to get images, videos, and downloads to subscribers as close and fast as possible. By partnering with CDNs such as Akamai, Limelight, and Level 3, the service provider can potentially offload a great deal of Internet traffic and improve customer experience by bringing the “cloud” multiple hops closer to the subscriber.   In the case of Akamai, they are known to evaluate the ASN of a service provider and offer to colocate their own special Akamai servers at no charge within the service provider point of presence where subscriber broadband traffic is aggregated. This improvement in the online experience is notable for subscribers that are into gaming.  While the games are often played over the Internet, the real benefit in the gaming experience comes when gaming patches and related game downloads are exclusively distributed by “cloud” providers. Also, as most Over the Top (OTT) programming is delivered via “cloud” providers, that experience is enhanced as well.  While OTT is not without controversy, ultimately the subscriber experience is defined by the quality of the broadband solution delivered by the service provider. Private Clouds [Private “clouds” and hybrid “clouds” represent the highest margin opportunity for service providers.  By creating an on demand infrastructure that targets business class subscribers the service provider can deliver everything from hosted applications to advanced connectivity and network security to enable signifiant savings over CAPEX intensive alternatives. Service providers should be looking at how they can train staff in disruptive solutions from Google such as Google Apps.  Google Apps resellers and integrators are growing but are not always within immediate reach for high touch needs of service providers.  Since launching a few years ago, Google Apps approach has been formulated to be especially attractive to the business customers of service providers.  For the business customer concerned with investments already within their IT closet, a service provide could offer a managed Google Secure Data Connector (SDC) as one way to enable and conduct business in a secure and repeatable manner within Google Apps. Microsoft is also looking for service providers to partner with and is offering healthy incentives to do so in the form of margin.   In essence, Microsoft has enabled service providers to become centers of excellence in providing an array of collaboration solutions ranging from Exchange to Sharepoint.  These familiar products are well known to businesses and come with the marketing might of Microsoft. Amazon and other Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting providers allow the creation of a service provider partnership.  This partnership allows the service provider to defer up front CAPEX in favor of easily passed along OPEX for instances where an application has to be hosted outside of geographic market for business continuity or disaster recovery (DRBC) purposes.  As all of these solutions for a business would require connectivity an managed security, the service provider is uniquely positioned to solve that part of the DRBC puzzle as well. As you might imagine, a recent entrant into this space is Cisco. The Cisco vision extends to enable private “clouds” in both enterprise and the service provider market.  By providing the server hardware, software, and networking fabric used by “cloud” hosting providers to a service provider, a “cloud” can be up and running very quickly and with network integration and TCO as the top draw. Finally, the main benefit for “cloud” is the speed to provision high margin hosted applications and services.  This benefit is what makes “cloud” attractive to the savvy service provider: impulse enablement.  The notion of turning on a server, application, or an entire collection of applications for the month they are need – and just as quickly shutting them down again may sound contrary to an industry known for long term contracts.   However, by lowering the friction and by using self service approaches, the service provider nearby becomes a trusted first call from subscribers.  By making it easy to do business, subscribers are more likely to work with you locally than to seek out options in the public “cloud”. Keep your head in the clouds View more presentations from Jay Cuthrell. Parting Clouds When considering what “cloud” represents it is important to understand where the marketing terminology ends and the opportunity begins for the service provider.  By taking a partnership approach to novel devices such as netbooks, partnerships with CDNs, and applying COTS solutions to create private clouds, the service provider can quickly enter the “cloud” marketplace by delivering first class broadband that links subscribers to solutions that deliver high value.

Here’s why…[Just like there is a heat map for most solid analytics packages – the ability to gauge sentiment overall is a critically important tool to have in larger organizations.  More importantly, the SAS demo focused on the well worn paths and pairing the tool with a SAS professional service is spot on. Granted, you have to tune SAS SMA as you would any tool.  For those expecting “AI”,  that’s just not a realistic way to position this new classification of toolset. Yet. Okay, back to the “Sentiment by Media Source” screen.  This demo was of a fictional brand/company of course but it was real data.  What did it show you? “How you are perceived on Huffington Post vs. Twitter vs. Crooks and Liars”. Think about what that means for a moment. Yes, there is an audience to care about.  And possibly ones not to care as much about… perhaps? The Teragram acquisition made by SAS is paying dividends in this platform on the textual analysis side. The SAS Media Workbench was shown and one could classify minutia such as wicked. Example: wicked Wicked Good vs. Wicked Ways vs… uh… WICKED WICKED While the tools provided cater to the larger enterprise entity, there is going to be feedback loop and learning in the tools (SaaS has that unique property) that filter down to the SME and possibly SMB markets.  Before that takes place, an agency model will be explored as a competitive differentiator. This is a SaaS play from SAS. Say that three times really fast. The data sets come from SAS’s own web/api crawlers normally but this was driven with data from a third-party data aggregator for the purpose of the demo.  Yet, my take away is that this SaaS approach will lend to flexibility outside of a purely SAS vertical integration. The demo shown didn’t cover location based services or geocoding analysis but there is a call center email by geographic location analysis being done.  As I think in telecom terms (often) for new technology, this is welcome news.

Security Elements Everywhere (SEE)       [a] “Public” (Anyone on the Interwebs)        [b] Facebook (Anyone on Facebook)        [c] Friends Only (Anyone I added as a friend)        [d] FoF (Anyone my Friends add as Friends)        [e] Private (only I can see this)    Note for any FB vanity search wonks reaching this comment: feel free  to steal “SEE” backronym   Pictorially showing the exposure counts for information would be  worthwhile — i.e. your information will be shown to       (a) The Internet!        (b) 450M users        (c) 4609 people through your friends        (d) 230 of your  friends        (e) just you    Unfortunately, this SEE design runs counter to the implied goals of  the FB product management to opt-out sharing.  Ramming opt-out on a base  of FB accounts is the latest reason I (and others) question FB motives.   Also, in the wake of the recent FB privacy change [1], no pushing of  the live feed to the left/right/top/bottom changes the damage inflicted  to any perceived trust of the FB platform. FB as a place for friends is a  far away reach.  Regression testing must be really, uh, hard.  As a  result, FB reserves the right to just dump everything about you into a  search engine somewhere as part of “progress” or so-called iterative  design improvements.       [1] no major epiphany here because the privacy policy is basically  the fine print with most of what gets tossed out with every credit card  terms of service or privacy notification for other service you might  sign up for these days — where everything about you is up for sale﻿ If you have an hour to spare… watch this video.  This was the talk that helped launch young minds thinking about where the Internet is headed.     ","categories": ["Consulting Days","friday fudge"],

        "title": "Short URL Link Rot",
        "excerpt":"The notion of “link rot” comes up from  time to time in blog type discussions where someone has a passing  preservation or historical bent﻿.  The real-time nature of content being consumed and the promoted concepts of brevity have led to the perceived need for short URLs.  Now witness the glory of short URL services. Of course, this isn’t new.  In fact, the bulk of this post comes from a year old comment I made over at VentureBeat that was previously unavailable to refer back to when VentureBeat wiped all legacy comments (WordPress?) from view before importing them back into DISQUS.  I don’t know what the URL anchor to my comment would have been within WordPress but Google cached a copy and I was able to find it.  Lucky huh?  Lucky probably won’t work long term though.  You see, the article was relating to short URL’s or so-called URL shortening services. What I had to say then is the same thing I have to say now about these short URL services: Let’s hope they have an archive.org export or database escrow in their funding plans. Here’s what I  mean:  I’ve been using LiveJournal for a long time (+10 years in fact).  One  of the things I loved about LiveJournal was how easily I could post  links to my favorite cNet articles from news.com.  It was awesome.  I could post a link, a  comment on it, and it was fun to share with folks/etc.  Of course, this was  before this whole share-centric web evolved before our eyes in the past  few years. One of the areas I’ve been interested in lately in the  wake of our here today and gone tomorrow approach to the web has been  link rot.  After reviewing some of my entries from years gone by on  LiveJournal, my comments and links to news.com just don’t make any sense now. Why? Well, the URL’s I posted don’t go anywhere useful, there is no context  relevant SEO word loading… etc.. etc… it’s just a 404 Not Found  redirecting to a page with no help or relevant hint as to what I was  referring to or talking about.  I also learned that “Hah, this is cool!”  does not make for very good metadata.  Lesson learned. So, I  have to wonder how long short.url/something will really be available for  the long haul… whatever that long haul might be.  If a tinyurl.com or the many  clones die… what happens to their hash database tables that present  the magic 301 redirect to where you would be going?  What about that?   Does it matter?To that end… http://tinyurl.com/thiswascool10yearsagoandhttp://bit.ly/thiswascool10yearsago The other thing that has come up with services such as Twitter and Facebook that increasingly take over third-party functions and make them core functions.  In the case of short URL and redirection, doing a double redirect will likely have different approaches to “protect” those using the service. This could be interstitials, Digg-like bars that frame content, or any of a variety of methods that just alter the status quo of how things work(ed) when navigating the web. The innovation will likely have some concerns raised as it becomes more pervasive and visible to the masses.  What is less likely is that the bank shot will work 100% of the time. That’s the part of this that hasn’t been explored at high volume.  Ultimately, this comes down to the desire to recreate AOL key words or somehow create artificial scarcity in name space. Let’s just hope those crazy combination bank shots are recorded somewhere for posterity and that someone made enough money to license re-runs. ","categories": [],

        "title": "Memo to the Cloud",
        "excerpt":"[ Disclaimer: I made the jump to cloud and SaaS a long time ago.  I have the scars. With luck, after adding a few more they’ll just look like skin. In the multi-billion dollar market of all things SaaS and cloud, I am a minor account in my consumption. My clients, however, are not so minor. So, if you are a SaaS or cloud solutions provider, know this: Be assured that as a consultant in telecom and infrastructure… and as a regular speaker/attendee at conferences and places where others like me both share and ingest insights – you are under a myriad of microscopes of vicious resolution. Does this word _“support” _mean what you think? Recently, I went through a series of back and forth support emails with a SaaS company.  The company involved isn’t important.  It could have been any company.  I pay them.  They provide value. Fair deal right? That’s enough for this story to continue….Basically, after going back and forth a few times with an anonymous ticket email address I felt that my contribution to the thread was being ignored or, as I like to say, it was met with the death knell of a boilerplate response. Hi, have we met before? Here’s a quick heads up for those of you reading this that have a horse in the race: This type of boilerplate response is inexcusable. The boilerplate response says you don’t care.  The boilerplate response screams out NOT MY PROBLEM. The boilerplate response tactic does come up during lunch sessions at the birds of a feather table at your user groups, your conferences, and the local watering hole that your customers meet at to talk shop.  This is an important concept that a great many SaaS and cloud thinking shops might miss – it’s never been easier for customers to talk about you. At the risk of going all social media right about now… your customers have become an audience.  In fact, the audience is passing notes, whispering, and sometimes having a conversation in the lobby. [ While the line of cloud, SaaS, managed, hosted, and self hosted gets very blurry – ultimately, the more self service and troubleshooting tools you make available to your customer accounts the more attuned you have to be to avoiding the boilerplate response. Wait?  Is that a catch-22?  Does this mean that self-service and troubleshooting tools will provide a more robust experience for those parties wishing to ascertain issues closer to the real-time required by a business?  Or, does this mean that I have to invest in a support staff that can simply refer the customer back to the self service tools? Answer: Yes.  You’re expected to give more visage into the back office AND raise your game in the tier commensurate (I used that word a lot lately) experience delivered by your support staff. See also: Pick. Up. A. Phone. Call. Your. Customer. Other things I’ve noticed that are poor practice are any attempt to obfuscate a support resolution path.  Examples include hiding phone numbers, use of no reply emails, reliance on heavy automation that assumes edge cases are always edge cases.  You will fail in ways that go beyond SLA. Want to add salt to a customer wound?  Don’t provide regular communication regarding changes for contact and support information.  Examples include changing support site navigation, moving a /contact url from something that is front and center to a buried 5 clicks deep approach, and generally forgetting to test your IVR from simulated time zones that are not the ones your developers happen to sit in for day testing. Try this type of innovation and don’t expect to get a lot of renewals. [ And now… the bottom line It’s tempting to be clever and think you’ve figured something new to drop out operational costs that has never occurred to anyone before you.  Hint: It’s a trap. Don’t let your automation and refinements obliterate the initial experiences that closed the deal and garnered praise.﻿ ","categories": ["Consulting Days","friday fudge"],

This presentation will highlight the latest in LI technology, LI challenges , and how each of us can shape future of how LI is perceived and used.﻿ Level: Advanced Audience: Individuals that value Internet neutrality and privacy should attend to understand how LI approaches may affect them.  Creators of social services that offer a social contract should understand how their own technical choices can offset LI concerns and give power back to the user on the network. Those that operate networks should attend to understand the implications of LI in an increasingly hyper-connected world.﻿ Questions Answered:       Why should you care about Lawful Intercept (LI) if LI is a tool for the good guys?﻿         How does LI fundamentally alter your social contracts back and the architects of the social web?﻿         Who is behind LI that you should take to task today and in the future?﻿         Where can you get involved in watching the watchers involved in LI?﻿         What can you do about LI after you walk out of this session?﻿   Speaker: Jay Cuthrell is a strategic technology consultant to telecom service providers, startups, and investment groups.

Yet, I’m always cognizant of those that came before my sudden arrival at SxSW as a yearly pilgrimage option.  Indeed, the mix of faces has been hard to qualify as any one group or type of individual.  My appearance at SxSW is part of the larger overall expansion of the body count.   So, it might be worth examining the impact SxSW had on me each year so far. [ In 2008, I captured my thoughts in the wake of what began the current 2 year trip into “what will I do next” with The Taco Thesis. Everything was shiny and new. In 2009, my ambition to speak turned into a core conversation about Too Much Text. Everything was still shiny and new but bigger than before with regard to content. In 2010, the panelist role became a reality. Again, everything was huge but more organized and the spaces were larger.  This was the year that shiny and new moved from the content to the attendees. So does that mean 2011 will be a pendulum swing from attendees to content or perhaps something new happens?  Time will tell.   [ Here’s what I do know about the vibe for SxSW 2011 so far:       There are three panels submitted regarding agriculture and technology.

[ The use of Compellent was an obvious portion of the discussions but it was difficult to pin down a correlation that was direct. There were the obvious references to “hero” reports but the impact was in terms of storage purchasing and effective use (green pickup by powering down). With VMware it is possible to have the IT customers enabled to clone, create, and test quickly vs. going through the previous (traditional) processes associated with responding to such a requirement.  The maturity of specific tiers of storage buckets was highlighted in that high performance (SSD) tiers are for HPC applications and then there is “other” that moves to SATA. Through a line of questions it was determined that the arrival at differing allocation of storage was discovered through analysis of server load – NOT through any automatic or so-called proactive feedback loop (PFL).  The leading question was to draw out a “do you want something that decides for you” but it appears that scenario might not have translated.

I’m still based in Research Triangle Park, NC and Missoula, MT but anyone that knows my background also knows you can find me on the road traveling for customers and industry events.  Of course, when I am back in the Triangle area I expect to get lots of quality stick time on the amazing environments here in the new Raleigh, NC office where Team Jonathan (Jonathan Donaldson) drives vertical solutions on the Vblock architecture and performs customer facing engagements. Why join forces with VCE / Acadia?    I’m going to be perfectly frank.  I think Vblock architecture rocks.  Oh, you wanted more?  Well, as you may know, I have an affinity for startups, service providers, and investment groups.  Previously, I’ve been a CTO, VP, GM, Infrastructure Architect, and most recently an independent consultant with my own consulting practice. During my career I’ve been arm in arm with service providers as their data centers have evolved and I’ve also been the service provider experiencing that evolution first hand. Having sat on both sides of the table, this is an exciting time for me. What caused you to make this move?   Of course, I’d known about Acadia and I’d known about VCE for a while. I had formed some early opinions… lots of opinions.  I did my research.  I attended conferences.  I talked shop with my trusted peers.  I met and spoke with folks within the VCE / Acadia organization. Then I made my move.   Side note: You’d be amazed at how effective blaring Peter Gabriel’s “In Your Eyes” from the parking lot under an executive briefing area can be.   One last interesting factoid: As it turns out, I am often updating CrunchBase with new companies I come across in my travels here and there (I’m still the top non-TC contributor as of this blog post btw… flex).  One of those bold new ventures I came across was VCE / Acadia.  The competitive leader board side of me realized that there wasn’t an entry for Acadia in Crunchbase. So, I fixed that. Why get involved with private cloud now?  Are you hiring?   Yes! vSuperheroes in the house! Acadia is growing a number of teams.  You’ll want to start by reviewing this entry from Chad Sakac since it… well, you’ll just have to read it! Enjoy! There are many ways to contact me but reach out to me via Linkedin if you see a fit and I will do my best to route you to the right channels.  BTW, please be on the lookout for the new vSpecialist Christmas Album on DVD and Blu-ray! [ Where should Cuthrell Consulting, LLC service provider and infrastructure clients go now?   I’m still here and now you have a trusted advisor within Acadia.  Let’s chat! What about the other guest blog and writing you do elsewhere?   I’m hopeful my time management skills will permit me to reach out on subjects I’m known for writing about beyond fudge.org. I am extremely grateful to the folks at Telecompetitor and ReadWriteWeb for giving me amazing platforms and the opportunity to share my views on a wide variety of topics.  In short, I hope to continue my contributions as time permits and demand dictates. Does this mean fudge.org becomes a corporately controlled blog?   Nope. I’ll be updating my disclosure statement to be less terse and adding some pertinent boilerplate which will make it even more boring.  Again, this blog will always be 100% USDA certified Jay Cuthrell aka @qthrul.   I’ll be writing about things I care about.  That won’t ever change. Hey, maybe Friday Fudge will come back into regular circulation again. We shall see. Speaking of @qthrul… Does this mean @qthrul on Twitter becomes a corporately controlled Twitter account?   Nope. I’ll be updating my bio line for @qthrul to reflect pretty much whatever fits into a form element.  “I fill out web forms” has served me well so far.  Due to the nature of how Twitter functions as a connected API accessible medium, I can only say that my tweets will always be 99.999% USDA certified Jay Cuthrell.   One of my favorite replies on Twitter has to be (parphrased) “Jay, I understand about 1 out of every 7 things you tweet”.  It’s a good bet my tweets will be as geeky and random as ever.  Twitter is a limited engagement medium of course so the longer format of blogs and extraneous append/edit models of Google Buzz are better for protracted discussion.

        "excerpt":"[there have been lots of emails, tweets, phone calls, IMs, and related reaching out to ask me one thing: **Duuuude! What’s it like?!?!** It seems that many are wondering what the VCE / Acadia experience is like.  Looking back on what seems like several months… Where to begin? How about: “Work hard. Play hard.”  While short and sweet, this is a very accurate portrait of how the past 30 days have gone by in VCE / Acadia. As the one month mark from my start day passes silently in the caffeine fueled night… I’ve come to realize that I am riding the rocket.  In the immortal words of T. Callahan Jr. — Tommy Likey! Some of the other questions I’ve gotten are a bit more pointed and direct. **Dooouuuuuuuude, what are you working on??!?!** Oddly enough, I’m working on many of the things I was before: service provider transformation, service catalog evolution, executive strategy, tactical execution.  The difference? The power of three. As for the clients and customers I am working with… watch my Twitter stream and when public announcements are made I’ll make the effort to send out links. In a nutshell, there are some amazing changes that will take place in the industry and I’ll be happy to share as I always have… including videos of cats on turtles. [**DooOOOooouUUuuudE, just gimme some details!!!** Okay. I know details matter. I’ve been getting to know more of the vArchitects, onboarding, and traveling the friendly skies. While I expected this team to be awesome coming into VCE / Acadia I had no idea just how awesome a team until I was on the inside. This is a team that knows how to grow and rapidly bring others into the mix very efficiently. If you’ve had any experience with startups you would be quite at home.  The amount of information shared once I was on the team is still causing reverberations in my mind even as I type this entry a month later. [I’ve also been training with a worldwide group of VCE / Acadia team members and team building.  Again, the speed is what really sticks out in my mind.  Highlights so far include seeing the vArchitect team grow and working with wicked smart folks in the VCE parent organizations. In the past month since I’ve come on board I’m pretty sure I slept at least one night. Looking back I think that was after an offsite team builder consisting of football, Texas BBQ, beer, and big screen monitors the size of a building. When I reviewed my inbox and sent folders, call logs, notebook, travel receipts, and stepped away from the screens for a moment it dawned on me. I’m having fun. There just aren’t enough hours in the day.  This is about a singular focus on enabling ubiquitous workload substrates in data centers around the world.  This is about an amazing team that shares the vision of a better way to make this a reality. [**DooooooOOOOuUuuuuDE, what’s the team like!??!?!** Passion. Adrenaline. Exuberance. Excellence. These are just a few of the words one could use to describe the team. Also, judging from my AMEX card… one could also add “thirsty” to that list of descriptions. Now a full month in I’m happy to report the best is yet to come and… **DoooooouUUUUuuuude, what’s coming next!?!?!??!?!** Shhhhh. Stay tuned. :wink: ","categories": ["friday fudge","VCE"],

In the past 60 days since I’ve joined VCE there has been cold weather in Boston, Montana, RTP, etc… but all of my trips were tempered with warm receptions and the high energy of VCE team members, VCE parent team members, vSpecialists Team 04 [1], VCE Partners, and of course VCE customers! Since my first 30 days update, my solo talk at SxSW on CALEA was accepted and scheduled.  If you are attending SxSW be sure to set aside your Sunday to attend “Lawful Intercept: I Saw What You Did”. Also, when I pushed that update I was semi-growing a small marsupial on my upper lip. That’s right. I was able to share my month long devotion to facial follicular fantasy via Movember to raise awareness for and raise research funding for cancers that affect men.  I subjected everyone I met during this time to the fuzz du jour.

I’m drinking nothing but water through March 5 (SxSW starts after that btw… heh).  Why? Think about how easy it is for you to drink water each day. Now imagine that being a chore, a high involved series of steps, or a daily struggle. If you know me you know I’m someone that enjoys all kinds of beverages. For the next 90 days I intend to drink only water. No sodas, no beer (!!!!), no wine, no tea, no coffee, no milk, no juice… just water. $9000 represents 90 families having access to water.

I’ll pick a comment at random and donate my Google TV from the Google I/O 2010 developer program to the local charity/cause/GTUG of their choosing. _ Just let me know in your comment if that is of interest to you. And now… the actual content you likely came here for in the first place… That Guy in VCE Q&amp;A Time Since becoming that guy in VCE, great questions keep coming to my inbox about VCE and Vblock.  Here are just a few I’ve answered since my last update that came in from you curious, gentle, and thoughtful readers (reprinted with permission with edits). [_Are you working for Acadia or VCE?_   We’re all VCE now… and of course it’s more than just the branding. The Acadia brand/charter has been set aside to make sure a vibrant channel and VCE Partner community can flourish and grow quickly.  I’ll cover the VCE Partner and channel question you posed below as well. As with any branding change, it will take time for the sunsetting of the Acadia brand.  I just happen to have more VCE branded attire than I do Acadia branded attire. If you attended the Gartner Data Center Conference you would have seen the new VCE logo and brand at our booth. [_What kind of traction are you seeing for Vblock?_   Our CEO, Michael Capellas shared some details at the Gartner Data Center Conference on traction for Vblock.  From these comments, Wikibon coverage of VCE indicated that VCE has a significant base of major customers worldwide for Vblocks and that VCE is targeted to add even more customers for Vblocks before the close of 2010. What’s important to understand is how customers consume Vblocks today and the seamless support that VCE provides to them.  Vblock is not a mere reference architectures you can fold up in your back pocket – Vblocks are ubiquitous workload substrates for data centers to deliver SLA backed solutions with unified support that arrive in a ready to consume state. Just add power, network, and go to market! Of course, I’m unable to share the actual number of customers and Vblocks but it’s a very safe use of the “s” to make Vblock plural! On a personal note I’ve never been more energized and BUSY that I’ve been since joining VCE…. I am truly riding the rocket. [Are potential customers having scalability concerns with the parts that make up a Vblock?   Short answer: No. Long answer: Each selection of components that make up the Vblock have competitive vertical and horizontal scaling patterns mapped to real work workloads which are vetted through testing.  The amount of engineering hours put into the design and delivery of a Vblock is simply awesome. While there is always a “speeds and feeds” conversation taking place in the industry, where Vblock stands apart is in the manner in which scale is brought to bear in a useful and consumable fashion. Specifically, Vblock is unrivaled in time to scale and rate of return on invested capital and the single pane of glass approach to ongoing management of the investment. Consider that a Vblock delivery takes place on pre-engineered, pre-wired, and pre-configured and fully populated cabinets in structured racks on shipping pallets. By only requiring the unpacking, powering, and networking to the aggregation layer means that Vblock customers are capable of making x86 virtual machines in just a few hours. More importantly, as these are workload driven goals the first VM stays within the SLA parameters desires as well as the (n)th VM created within the Vblock solution. Personally, I’ve been involved with gargantuan Vblock deals, POC/Demo Vblock deals, and all Vblock points in between.  In the sizing of these Vblocks, the workload driven configuration tools made available to VCE parents dovetail with our own internal VCE tools.  As these tools are made available (soon!) to VCE Partners and the channel, I expect a better understanding of Vblock scale to be approached and visualized as hysteresis curves or bubble charts and not simply a coarse MIN vs. MAX discussion.  Be sure to review VCE Partner Portal for updates on these tools and training slots. [_Who are the players you are seeing that compete with VCE and Vblock?_   The big names in the room are easy to name. VCE and her parents (Cisco, EMC, VMware) are all vying for the same data center market as the likes of IBM, HP, Oracle, etc… Regardless of what sleepy cat has waded into market for consuming data center real estate, VCE’s attitude is “Game On” and has been since the moment the company was formed just over a year ago as the trend setter and first mover in this space. The most satisfying part of competition is seeing our list of VCE Partners grow so rapidly.  VCE Partners provide insight, detail, and understanding of the customer needs and requirements as well as the challenges to consuming IT in a new way.  VCE Partners are essential to making it permissible for customers to consume Vblock. [What is happening with VCE partners and the channel?   Great things are happening.  In fact, in my own day to day work I’m working with VCE Partners more often than not.  When I attend social tech events I’m advising every VAR I know to take a good hard look at VCE, do earnest research, and provide feedback to our Partner and Channels teams. What is clear is desire for Vblock is strong.  You have a valid question and I want you to be curious and skeptical. Did you know that many VCE Partners have already delivered Vblocks to their customers?  It’s true.  BTW, you can be one of those VCE Partners too! The BOOM moment is where VCE is the catalyst and accelerant to help VCE Partners win Vblock deals early and often.  There are already great resources our our portal.  If you haven’t reviewed the VCE Partner Portal – make the time to review and let us know what you think! [1] The vSpecialist Team04 Giddyup like no other! ","categories": ["VCE"],

Here are just a few I’ve answered since my last update that came in from you curious, gentle, and thoughtful readers (reprinted with permission and significant edits). What can you share with me about VCE since your last post? Are you going to post more than once every 30 days?   [Anytime. Anywhere. Everywhere. Those words describe what I have come to understand about the demand for what we are doing within VCE. This past week and month marks milestones for VCE and me personally.       The VCE brand and new vce.com website was formally launched!        I reached my 90 day mark at VCE!  I plan to increase my post frequency in 2011. I’m not clear how much long form there will be but the 30 day updates will probably be the longer entries. My goal is to bring emphasis on areas I am passionate about relating to Vblock and how it enables Service Providers to execute in an accelerated manner. I’m very much into collaboration technologies, software development practices, telecommunications transformation, and anything that will power the next great startup companies as they demand instantaneous infrastructure and platform services. For now, all I can say is stay tuned! Hey, I just saw your Linkedin update! Have you been promoted already?!?!   Yes. Yes, I have. Clearly, someone has a great sense of humor. :wink: My new title is quite the mouthful.  Here goes: Manager, Service Provider Sales vArchitect Team for the Americas Double Barrel Polka Esplanade of Large Scale Artisanal Cheeses Production and Manufacturing As you might imagine, I’m growing an already amazing team of vArchitects for Service Provider Sales. That means I’m looking for polished pre-sales consultants and pre-sales engineers that live, breathe, and convey virtualized infrastructure with service provider and / or media and entertainment experience. Also, it goes without saying that VCE as a whole is growing. Where are you growing teams now?   [Presently, I’m focused on growing vArchitect teams in the following places:       Raleigh-Durham        Atlanta        Denver        Los Angeles        San Francisco        Silicon Valley        Mexico City        São Paulo        Rio  Of course, other teams are being grown around the world as well.  This is just my list for this week. :smile: I’m still at [redacted] but I’ve got to admit I’m very curious about VCE now that I’ve read our competitive analysis. Vblock makes so much more sense than what we’ve been proposing to customers. Does my background at [redacted] count against me now? LOL! Are you drinking the kool aid or Bourbon now?   [are amazing. The journey is underway. Don’t worry about your contrary positions at [redacted] and where you are now in [redacted]. For what it’s worth, there are several team members within VCE that had stints at [redacted]. Sometimes it just takes a while to see the bigger picture and then follow your passions. This is about the evolution of the datacenters we’ve been working in and around for years. This is about realizing ubiquitous workload substrates. Do you seriously want to keep customers going in the direction you are now at [redacted]? Again, this is a journey. Ask yourself if you can look your customer in the eye and know you can bring them on this journey where you are now. I can assure you that at VCE we accelerate that journey. Oh, as for kool-aid, I’m still more into Scotch but if you want a Bourbon recommendation I can ping an expert! I’m interested in VCE! Are you a hiring manager?   Yes. If you or someone is interested in being part of the team at VCE please drop me a note to my jay.cuthrell@vce.com email address with SUBJECT: Ride the Rocket and I’ll put it in front of our VCE recruiters ASAP on the fast track. [Also, absolutely feel free to pass this along elsewhere. If you have any questions just let me know. Where do you get your information to stay current?   [I get that question a lot lately. I’ll spare you the kitten videos.  Lately, what I’ve been reading or more directly, who I’ve been reading is folks with VCE.  Here are some suggestions in no particular ordering:       Jeramiah Dooley’s Virtualization for Service Providers        Justin Guidroz’s Geaux Virtual        Steve Chambers’ View Yonder        Jae Ellers’ Mister VM        Trey Layton’s Virtual Architect        Kendrick Coleman’s Virtual Bourbon        Aaron Delp’s Random Thoughts        Kenneth Hui’s vArchitect Musings  I’ll be adding to this list and be putting up a blogroll soon with OPML and instructions for creating your own RSS and buzzword heaven using my Google Reader API examples explained over at ReadWriteWeb a few months ago. _What trade shows and conferences will you be attending or presenting at this year? _   [ I’ll be at many events for 2011. Trips since my last update include visits to Boston, New York, and Miami. One of the many benefits of being based in Research Triangle Park, NC is that in addition to the RDU airport being nearby I’m also very close to the VCE teams, Cisco campus, and EMC campus. Knowing that VCE opportunities are truly worldwide prompted me to get my passport renewal expedited. I’ve also been updating my Plancast and TripIt to make sure the VCE curious can connect with me more easily.

Soooo much has happened and that familiar startup feeling is there – you wish there was another four 8 hours in a day! What’s new since the last update? Lots of things!  I’d like to take a small departure from the previous Q&amp;A format and talk a bit about where I’ve been and what I’ve been up to at VCE and along the way while riding the rocket! Riding the rocket while the rocket is being built [ Since my last update I’ve been traveling to meet with VCE Partners, representing VCE at trade shows, growing my vArchitect team, training, and spending lots of quality time with service providers. During my travel far and wide I’ve had a chance to visit with VCE Engineering as well as R&amp;D teams at VCE offices and VCE Parent offices. I’ve also enjoyed stops in Orlando for VMware Partner Exchange 2011 as well as San Francisco for RSA Conference 2011. Somewhere in this whirlwind tour I also got to spend time with my vArchitect team at Geek Week in Atlanta. Rolling out the Vblock one floor tile at a time RSA Conference 2011 was a solid week of meeting the top minds in all things security related.  Simultaneously, the story of service providers implementing Vblock Trusted Multi-Tenancy was the top draw for the VCE booth. It was clear that the audience understood the value of Vblock. During the luminary presentations on Vblock Trusted Multi-Tenancy our sprawling attendees caused a standstill around the VCE booth as everyone was jockeying for position to hear the vision and implementation details from the Harris Trusted Enterprise Cloud team. [ Just a week before my trip to San Francisco I also represented VCE at VMware Partner Exchange 2011. VMware PEX took me to Orlando and I enjoyed getting to hear from VCE Partners that have been taking Vblock to their customers and getting their perspective on what is coming soon. Before my trip to Orlando, Geek Week took me to Atlanta with my vArchitect team from vSpecialist Team04. It was an amazing time to put our collective knowledge to the test. The Geek Week format really shows you just how much the EMC vSpecialist curriculum offers in terms of professional challenge coupled with the rewards of team settings. [ Speaking of my vArchitect team, I’m ecstatic about the talent on the Service Provider Sales vArchitects team in the Americas and hope to profile some of the folks on the team.  Almost all of us have a blog, Twitter handle, etc. so I’d like to share the link love when possible! Growing my team for the Service Provider Sales vArchitect team in the Americas is tracking along nicely. To accomplish this I’m spending my time reviewing impressive candidates via phone calls, WebEx sessions, Cisco TelePresence, and face to face meetings as I travel far and wide. And speaking of travel, I expect to travel to meet the top vArchitect candidates in the world. Since I’ll be needing a phone that works around the world, I’ve opted to replace my CDMA work phone with a GSM variety.  Thankfully my favorite app, WebEx, is on both Android and iPhone so I should be all set. [ Last but not least I’d like to make a special shout out to the team behind Plancast. Heading out to the West coast means the chance to take in the numerous events that take place on any given night.  If you consider geek population density it makes sense that the sheer volume of people that show up for planned and ad hoc events is staggering.  After consulting Plancast I was able to attend the Instameet SF - The first Instagram meetup and run into a host of movers, shakers, hipsters, my favorite tech writers, stealth startups, and generally neato folks.  In addition, thanks again to Plancast, I was able to catch up with even more of my West coast peeps at EFF’s 21st Birthday Party. So, thank you Plancast! ","categories": ["VCE"],

        "excerpt":"_** I’m looking at a draft folder of blog posts I plan to publish but I decided one post needed to go up now – kids and robots. One of the cool aspects of working at VCE is the ability to participate in various activities and outreach programs from Cisco, EMC, and VMware. One such EMC sponsored opportunity jumped out at me since it involved working with local middle school kids in Wake County here in North Carolina… and ROBOTS. Guess what?  They WON and are going on to the next level of NATIONAL competition… and they can use YOUR HELP.[ Moore Square Museums Magnet Middle School and Panther Creek High School bring home the GOLD!   Moore Square Museums Magnet Middle School and Panther Creek HS joined forces to become the first ever VEX Robotics NC State Champions on April 4, 2011 in Greensboro NC. The Moore Square VEX Robotics Team is an after school club. Club advisor, Mr. TJ Beatty, led a diverse group of 7th and 8th grade students through months of planning, building, testing and rebuilding to prepare for this robotics competition while being sure to stay within the specific parameters given to the team by TSA and VEX. Mr. Beatty boasts about the unrelenting desire shown by his students. “The team met every day before school, two days a week after school and frequently even ate their lunches while working in the lab.” he said. This year’s competition was titled VEX Roundup. Students were challenged to build a robot that would place plastic donuts onto goal posts of varying heights within the timeframe allotted.  The matches were run with 4 robots in the zone at one time operating in a 2 on 2 format. Students had to plan strategies for offense, defense and collaboration.  The robots were operated through autonomous (automatic) and driver controlled modes. The team now prepares to compete at TSA Nationals in Dallas, Texas.  This incredible learning experience was made possible by EMC2 from Durham, NC. They sponsored our teams’ start up cost by donating two complete VEX Robotic kits. The Moore Square Museums Magnet Middle School Vex Robotics Team still needs to raise a large amount of money to fund their trip to TSA Nationals.  The team is looking for sponsors and donations to help pay for hotel rooms, meals and entry fees.  If you are able to help please contact Mr. Beatty at tbeatty@wcpss.net Support your STATE CHAMPION VEX Robotics Team as they prepare to go to Dallas TX, and compete in the TSA / VEX National Championship – Make Checks payable to “M2M3 PTSA” The team has done an extraordinary amount of work and added enhancements that go far beyond the first robot prototypes.  Some of that work is super secret until they get to the competition floor.  A few specific areas that were addressed relate to robot protection strategies and robot power alignment methods. If you are working at a big company or a startup now, ask yourself how often you stay late to work on something… of how often you find yourself fitting in any spare time you have to work on a pet project or something that really captures your passion. Guess what? That’s precisely what these kids are doing right now.  They are building sweat equity in their robot creations.  And just in case you think this is lightweight engineering… Last week the team was putting together their C programs for autonomous operation. Also, the team is composed of boys and girls.  Women in engineering FTW!!! Pretty cool eh?  Did you get to do stuff like this when you were in middle school??? How can you not help but welcome our new robot overlords? If you are interesting in adding your support to the team on their trip to nationals you can also reach me via email at work  jay.cuthrell@vce.com or simply leave a comment.

        "title": "King of the Apps",
        "excerpt":"Last month saw the insanity that is Interop as well as EMC World. Both events were in Las Vegas. For me this was a week of back to back customer meetings and catching up with my peers. How many times did I hear cloud? A few. Was there beer involved? I don’t recall. Maybe? As luck would have it, I was fortunate enough to come across two amazing cloud based startup companies, Rarewire and Snap Appointments, that deserve to break the ‘What Happens in Vegas’ vow of silence. Rarewire and Snap Appointments How did I come across these two startup companies? Simple. I was invited by Rackspace [1] to participate as a judge in their King of the Apps event for the second round. The first round of King of the Apps included judges such as Robert Scoble, Eric Ries, Stacey Higginbotham, Dave McClure, and Bill Boebel. For round two the King of the Apps judges included Ted Nitka, Dan Woods, Jonathan Bryce, Andy Schroepfer, and some guy named Jay Cuthrell. We all headed to House of Blues and got to enjoy the pitches while the crowd enjoyed Tex-Mex and tasty beverages. [ Okay… Here’s the tale of the tape: Challenger: Rarewire Rarewire attacks the barrier to entry for content oriented app creation. By focusing on content developers that don’t want to create one-off native apps for iPad the Rarewire team is targeting a much wider audience than iPad developers alone represent. Here’s the video the Rarewire team shared in their pitch: It’s clear that Rarewire is taking the complex workflow of media intensive content creation and distilling it to a mechanism that liberates content developers – allowing then to move faster and with far less risk than traditional avenues to pad and mobile platforms. In fact, the folks at CA Technologies use Rarewire for their Cloud Leaders iPad app. You should definitely check it out and get your cloud on! 1st Round Defending Champion: Snap Appointments Snap Appointments is a 100% Rackspace cloud based SaaS startup. The Snap Appointments team won their spot during the Lean Startup track during SxSW this year. By fusing drop dead simple web based scheduling and just-enough-CRM, Snap Appointments caters to the tens of thousands of small businesses offering appointment oriented services: think salons, dentists, etc. Since SxSW, Snap Appointments has managed to land +450 businesses and see +5000 appointments booked through the service. Since the service is hosted entirely within the Rackspace cloud there is nothing for multi-site companies using Snap Appointments to install – just a web browser and an Internet connection. Here’s a great video the Rackspace team put together: Who won? What did they win? Find out now by heading over to read this writeup from the fine folks at Rackspace that made all of this possible and introduced me to these two amazing startups: Rarewire and Snap Appointments! [1] Disclosure: The Rackspace team got me a very good room rate for my stay in Las Vegas. Thanks again folks! ","categories": ["VCE","random"],

        "excerpt":"[Ah, metrics. Everyone loves a horse race. Of course, in a horse race it is not as if the horses are allowed to take a hyperspace jump to various points in the track outside of the assumed finite length of a race track. Enter the dilemma of any so-called “marketing intelligence” service selling you a stopwatch to determine who wins the race. Wait? What? See the article linked below my own footnotes. This mini-ramble is about Hitwise making a graph or something showing something growing or not growing or winning or not winning. I’m not picking on the article or Hitwise per se but the general notion of tracking service utilization in the fast paced world of iterative development with anything but the very broadest and most fluffy of metrics. Specifically, I question the ‘moving target’ element that Google+ and any such property tracked would exhibit. Consider that the way Hitwise tracks [1] today may not necessarily be the way tracking is done as properties evolve into new signatures, A/B testing, deep personalization, mobile or closed loop networks, leverage of partners or complementary partners, or shifts in the delivery infrastructure to favor SSL enabled experiences throughout [2]. [How do such services really compare the signature of today to the signature of next year? How do such services account for the possibility of egregious errors or failure to adequately capture the intentionally or unintentionally obtuse / obfuscated traffic indicators? Indeed, the quality of the time spent and the sharing gestures (text updates vs. photos vs. movies) may be harder and harder to glean as this data is considered part of the privacy contract and the salable asset of the property. Remember, you are the one feeding the machine as a user. As someone much more clever put it, “if the product is free that means you are what is for sale”. That may mean third party services that seek to classify and quantify user patterns are forced to disclose methodology in greater detail (ultimately owning up to how little they do know), striking deals with destinations to truly map such trends with a firehouse of data, or they are simply relegated to selling more art than science. Perhaps being the ‘outside view’ will come to be an even more literal condition.

        "excerpt":"  If this was easy, you wouldn’t be here. – VCE 101 Hi. It’s been a while. 300 days in fact since I joined VCE. 180 days since my last update on all things VCE. [Where to begin?!? In the past 180 days I’ve….       completed my team growth / development goals         worked with service providers all over the world         working shoulder to shoulder with EMEA and APJ teams         awed and amazed by EMC vSpecialists, VMware, and Cisco teams         humbled by the passion of VCE Partners         added to my +38 cities and +132 days on the road         renewed my VISA for Brazil         did my first solo talk at SxSW 2010         helping kids create our new robot overlords         attended customer meetings at Interop as well as EMC World         judged cloud based startup companies on Rackspace Cloud         spent several weeks living in San Francisco and Silicon Valley         worked on stuff I cannot blog about :wink:         seen more stuff I cannot blog about :wink:         managed to somehow… shrink… my suit…         Or… perhaps I need to explore cardio options?         Yeah.   While the Vblock wins have been awesome and getting Vblock in more places is incredibly satisfying to see happening… the hours have really been demanding. Lately, I’ve been having a lot of Twitter updates such as Good Morning EMEA and Goodnight APJ. My TripIt tells a tale from the point of view of the quest for making Vblock dreams come true. I get around. [New Title. Same Great Taste! You might recall from my previous updates that I quickly went from vArchitect to Managing vArchitect and then added in media and entertainment to my service provider focus. It’s been a while. Yes. It is now time to change titles again. My new title is Lead Principal vArchitect. I’m looking forward to this new role. Look for me at VMworld this month and stay tuned for updates. I cannot guarantee I won’t have a new title by then as well :wink: I’m also appreciative of the PR and marketing efforts from VCE, VCE Parents, VCE Partners, and the Vblock ecosystem of ISVs and Alliances. We have come a very long way. We have much to do. If only there were 28 hours in a day. [Haters Be Hatin’ One of the wonderful things about this converged infrastructure market is the complete adoring love between competitors and the histrionics free reporting and coverage in the tech press. Oh wait. I just woke up from my dream. :wink: The snark is alive and well out there. Link bait? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Perhaps just a fundamental lack of getting it or electing not to get it as a matter of snark for the sake of snark. Articles you say? It’s out there if you want to find it.  I’m not sending traffic there though. But more importantly, you’ll also see the clear and thoughtful retorts that follow in the wake of that big ole Snark Boat as it winds down Old Man Snarky River. [You… missed The best part of seeing all this hatin’ out there? Knowing that the bile soaked mouths that bite at you are only catching the shadows. Never. Stop. Moving. You cannot sit still. You cannot hesitate. You have to shift on the fly. Startup mode? I won’t invoke a pivot reference but any team in this space has to be as agile as the infrastructure you are creating. But But But Jay! You can’t just change your title like that before the ink on your last set of business cards is dry. That’s insane! You are doing something different than what you did 30 days ago! Companies just cannot work that way! That’s crazy talk! Crazy!!!!! I signed up for this. In fact, I chased after this, flagged down the rocket heading over the hill, and asked the person driving the rocket while working on the engine thrusters who I could talk to about changing the nose cone as the next orbital series approached. This is the rocket. Try and keep up. When I think of all the discussions around cloud lately and the inherent validation in the market for what VCE has been doing, I’m very proud of this team. This is hard stuff. And the best part is I get to help. Challenges? Absolutely. Changes? Wouldn’t have it any other way. Is this truly a competitive space? You bet. Enjoy the race. [The Road Ahead As always, there are things I want to shout from the roof in blog terms but – there is a proper time and place for that. :wink: I’m also already drafting up a “My First Year at VCE” post on Tuesday October 18, 2011. I’m planning to chart just how far things have come. It should be pretty slick and something a wider audience can appreciate. Oh yes, time. The time I would normally spend on creating content here these past 180 days has been expended on internally communicating behind the scenes, lighter than normal Twitter, and a short flirtation with Google+. If you were following that you probably saw some timely ahem updates fly by. [Obligatory Vblock pr0n This 180 days of radio silence is ending. GA products are out and about and touching on things of interest don’t give away anything that is beyond the realms of embargo. So, there will be things to talk about soon enough. My next update series will probably shift to “Friday Fudge” again if I can summarize my thoughts. Honestly, it’s pretty tough to discern what should be blogged about sometimes. I like posts that I can look back at a year from now and still see something that stands up well over time. Blogs tend to be thought of as time specific topical and weighted towards fast expiry.  We shall see. As always… Stay tuned and hand me that new nose cone prototype… ","categories": ["VCE"],

        "excerpt":"  “Our goal is to become an internal service provider” – VMworld visitor to the VCE booth [there are few areas more visible than VMworld 2011 taking place in Las Vegas. More on that later… Travel Updates The travel these past 30 days was much less intense for me. I attribute this to the alignment changes within teams to help keep folks from heading West to go East. That is a very welcome change. Working from RTP means being able to use WebEx and TelePresence vs. the wear and tear of travel. I’d specifically like to thank the other vArchitects (you know who you are!) that covered meetings local to their geo and helped keep folks like me from living out of hotels, rental cars, and airplanes. Truly. THANK YOU! In fact, if you follow my Plancast you’ll note I only took two trips in this span of time which included VMworld 2011 in Las Vegas. Not too shabby considering my prior nomadic ways! Of course, this week I’ll be heading out on the road again for customer visits… always a good reason! :smile: [VMworld 2011: Bigger Than Ever Of course what most folks want to know about when I get back from a trip like VMworld is… VMworld. Frankly, this might be boring to you if you are expecting what session I enjoyed the most of what lab I found to be totally amazing. But read on…. Why? Well, I spent most of my time with customers that have Vblocks and companies that want Vblocks. :smile: I did booth duty and the VCE booth for VMworld 2011 was nothing short of a powerhouse offering. Demos. Demos. Demos. Demos. The stories around FastPath and AlwaysOn were not only popular but timely. When the visitor to your booth describes your solution as what they want it doesn’t get any better than that. [We’re going to need a bigger boat booth… I also did customer advisory meetings in addition to one on one breakouts during VMworld. This gave me a chance to really listen closely to what is working, what could be better, and get feedback on where things are going. Being able to sit down and hear Vblock stories is always treat. When I wasn’t in the quiet and calm of the customer meetings away from the show floor, the traffic on the VCE booth was, in a word, INSANE. I know that VMware as a whole was larger this year but still… amazing numbers. I decided to look back at my blog post for VMworld 2010 and see how things were holding up there. What a great time that was. I’m looking forward to VMworld 2012 being in San Francisco again. Amazing location. You can actually go outside. :wink: In terms of contrasts from VMworld 2010 to VMworld 2011 what you can see is that last year I was clearly experiencing VMworld vs. being the experience. It’s an interesting change in perspective to say the least.  Both are rewarding and I’m fortunate to have seen it from both. In the company of rock stars Before VMworld started I was able to participate in and avoid serious bodily injury while raising money for a good cause playing v0dgeball. Good times indeed. In between and after my customer meetings at VMworld I was fortunate enough to be included on some of the lighter fare and events with fellow bloggers and luminaries of the cloud and virtualization world – many of them are the prolific ones you’ve probably got loaded in your RSS reader. These are truly the giants. RESPECT YO! One such event found me sitting in for a quick update from Brian Gracely, Nicholas Weaver, and Steve Kaplan on all things VMworld 2011 US for the Cisco Daily Blogger Techminute. Brian immediately sets the tone in this one :wink: I can’t wait to see what Nick pulls out of his hat next. Also, Steve really hits it on the head when he says “elevate the discussions and be more strategic”. That’s something I think we could all do more of in this space.   Brian Gracely (Cisco, Cloud Evangelist) leads a discussion with Jay Cuthrell, Principal Lead vArchitect at VCE; Steve Kaplan, VP Virtualization Practice at INX; Nick Weaver, Sr.vSpecialist at EMC Next up, I was invited to stand in (thanks @edsai and @jdooley_clt ! ) for a VMware Professional Brownbag with @cody_bunch, @DemitasseNZ, @gminks, and @storageio to discuss kittens and the Internets! We also managed to work in several airplane references. Heh! BTW – the visualization company is Real-Status and HyperGlance Plug-in for vCenter was being discussed – if you remember XMol from back in the day of SGI workstations this will probably give you serious deja vu… cool stuff! [Wait! You forgot the Vblock pr0n! No, I didn’t :wink: This time I got to see another of the road unit Vblock 300 FX in operation. On a side note… but an important one… the VCE team of field engineers and marketing folks that stands the VCE booth, demos, and Vblock for shows is truly amazing. They really go above and beyond. Having run trade show booths in the past I’m humbled by their attention to detail, their tenacity, and their constant iterative approach to improving the customer experience of visitors to the booth.

        "excerpt":"[ “We eat change for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks in between” – VCE team ethos A year ago today was my first day at VCE. I’m looking back briefly because it is already time to look ahead. The past year has been about immersion in a deep sea of change at a company forging a culture – and what I firmly believe is the way forward for an entire industry. Without a doubt, my time so far at VCE has been marked by change. Change in names, titles, processes, methodologies… changing planes, changing rooms, changing cars… :wink: But seriously, the majority of change fall into a category of continuous improvement. If you’ve ever read about or worked with minimum viable concepts or been around a startup you’ll appreciate what I mean by change. There are a lot of ways to track just how far things have come in the year I’ve been here. Many of the teams I’ve worked with here are veterans of VCE and prior. So, I keep reminding myself I’ve only been here for a year. Someone called me an ‘old timer’ this morning. Perhaps it is time to invest in some ‘Just For Men’ for my goatee? [ Also, this blog has been talking about VCE for over a year now. What I blog about is less about the speeds, feeds, or anything that is related to what goes into a Vblock — and more about what goes into VCE. What goes into VCE is the best talent I’ve worked with in my career. You know that saying about what it means if you are the smartest person in the room? (p.s. it means you are in the wrong room ) Well, in my estimation, I’m very much in the right room and at the right time. [ As I write this post I’m in Dallas for a visit to VCE HQ. We’ve come a long way from the Pizza Hut where I showed up for my first day of training. You can’t make this stuff up… It writes itself. By this time tomorrow I’ll be in Silicon Valley. I’m looking forward to attending the Cloud Mafia Meetup. Next week I’m really looking forward to seeing New Orleans when I get to speak at the Cloud Services Summit. And now… a subject near and dear to my heart… Wanted: Software Badasses Locally, I’m happy to see the VCE team in Research Triangle Park, NC growing and changing to reflect “where the puck is headed” for you hockey fans. So, I’ll be signing off on this post by highlighting two local spots we’re hiring for aggressively in software engineering: Software Engineers and Software QA Test Engineers.  What will these folks be doing and working on exactly? Orchestration. Orchestration. Orchestration. Orchestration. Orchestration software builds on ITIL best practices and disciplines, which define consistent, repeatable processes (or just-enough-ITIL if you like moderation in unicorns, rainbows, and lone wolves). It’s nice to know what you did on Monday is something you can do again on Friday. It’s even nicer knowing what you did was done to a level of satisfaction beyond a field in a database being toggled. It gets really amazing when you can tap against an API and get down and dirty on a command line AND have the option of ripping through a good enough GUI (or efficiently rolling your own). Want to get your OAM&amp;P/OSS/BSS on? Holler! Orchestration is far more than automating processes, adopting new management software, provisioning, configuration management, charge-back/billing, mediation, security, disaster recovery, operational support, and so on or making the transition to a lights out data center. You might say that orchestration is really what everything that you’d want to know is there and that most users assume already IS there. If your software developers and the stuff you use that comes from software developers is increasingly agile… it just makes sense to expect that the depth it sits upon should be just as agile. So again… check out the Software Engineers and Software QA Test Engineers listings and ping me if you have any questions or want to send your CV/resume over to jay.cuthrell at vce.com ","categories": [],

        "title": "Enhancement and Innovation",
        "excerpt":"We’re in the stone age right now — but we can’t stop trying to reach the bronze age while dreaming of the iron age. As I type up this blog entry I’m in Montana and it feels like home away from home. Next up is a visit to VCE HQ in Dallas for customer meetings. If all goes as planned, I’ll get home to North Carolina just in time for Thanksgiving. Before Montana it was Las Vegas for CA World. Before Las Vegas it was Silicon Valley and the Bay Area for customer meetings and Cloud Expo. Before that it was Philadelphia for customer meetings and really really good bacon. Thirty days ago I was typing up my My First Year at VCE where I highlighted all my travels before heading to Philadelphia. Do you sense a theme? Round Round Get Around Something occurred to me in those moments while I was on flights that don’t (yet) have WiFi on them. I’d like to share that but not in the sense of it being a grand epiphany but more in the way writing something down can free up space and time for more thoughts. It is easy to confuse enhancement with innovation. Let me explain… For months, I had planned on being in Raleigh for Internet Summit. Once again, I found myself traveling in the other direction. Duty calls. Still, I couldn’t help but notice folks on Twitter putting together connections even as I was heading the other way. When I reflected on this connectivity I felt the pang of missing something. If only I could have gone – then I would have found something… But wait. Why did I need to be at an event to find something? Only then at 37k feet was it clearer to me: It’s not about the technology, the demos, the networking functions – it’s about the people you run across and the conversations. Your assumptions are challenged from time to time. You are forced outside your comfort zones on subject matter, depth, details, and most importantly… Direction Direction? Yes. It’s become more apparent over my time in this land of all things cloud that the direction of the wind is only interesting if you are fashioning a sail. Put another way, if you are in any place where networks, compute, and storage are where you hang your hat – it’s going to be harder and harder to explain why your particular brand of wind is better wind than another brand. Also, the cold wind is drastically different than what passes today in the hot air category. In the past few weeks I’ve read tech website articles and blog entries that make me wonder if the people that wrote them, frankly, get it. I’ve known for years that general writing on the Internet is subject to all the things that make literature fans cringe – and I don’t consider myself immune to those critiques – but that ultimately translate to eyeballs, views, etc… yes, linkbait. But this isn’t about linkbait but a fundamental lack of understanding what is happening or the subject matter being discussed. I mention this because there is a function in play where coverage of enhancement for the sake of ‘me too’ or to simply weigh in on the minutiae. You can call it reporting. You can also call it a repurposing of mostly formed content for the sake of attaining a cadence or quota in article creation. FEED THE MACHINE. Setting aside the notion that the articles have to be written under a deadline, what else might explain this lack of truly meaty content? TL;DR Simple. Such a small word. We crave simple. We want simple. This post started with a desire to update folks on what I have been up to in VCE. If you made it this far then I can assure you that the time I spend in VCE is in seeking to make everything simple. Making something truly simple is innovation. Making something simpler is enhancement. This is why I love to talk with developers that have never built their own physical server (Hint: they are on the rise) because they are often shocked at the notion of anyone caring about infrastructure. BORING. But it is important to be clear that these developers are overwhelmingly found at consumer web oriented events and represent a sample set. One might argue the developers are creating things that are never seen publicly or that exist in areas far away from that of the consumer web. If you read Hacker News and Techmeme then ask yourself how often you see articles about SSD, Ethernet, FCoE, virtualization, CPU speed, etc… etc… if you haven’t been reading those sites – maybe you should start. Parents tell me about how their children will instinctively touch screens on TVs like they do with iPads. Wasn’t the iPhone just training wheels for the iPad which was training wheels for the whatever comes next? Now, ask yourself the last time you considered what was below the covers on an application you used. Remember those breathing/scrubbing machines in the Matrix – nobody remembered why or how it worked – it just worked. So, in terms of where things are going – the direction – it is much more about what sits on top of the stack and what is afforded than the elements that make up the stack. As such, there is going to be a struggle for where the tools, techniques, and namespace of what is old hat or passe in the consumer web world being placed on a collision course for demand for innovation. It was much better than Cats. There are plenty of companies we use today that we are not aware of or cognizant of in any way. If you sat back and searched for the term it might come to you but I’ll go ahead and spell it out: Service Providers.  Moreover, we’re only aware of them when they expose themselves when what they provide isn’t there or disrupts an experience. Dropped call/SMS/MMS? Upload failed? Browser timeout? Fail Whale? Stalled UI? The only way that the Internet can have more cat photos more of the time is to ensure that everything is in working order all of the time. To accomplish this it will require everything to be simple. My Other Datacenter is a Vblock Right now there are teams of people within companies large and small that are toiling and stressing over how to stack up servers, what goes into servers, where the storage is connected, and how the network will wrap it all together. Why? They want to do something. All of the infrastructure has to be there BEFORE you are able to do something. It has to be in the position where it fades away and leaves the possibilities. For developers at consumer web startup companies, this is why they both love and hate what passes today for public cloud services. They love getting up and running almost immediately. They hate the caveats and limitations that currently exist. It’s yes, but… Now imagine that companies of all shapes and sizes will want to have startup like speed for the things they care to move beyond a culture of defaults. They want to find service providers that can provide the private cloud experience. They want to know they get premium service and that their service provider understands what matters to the company and the developers within the company. It’s yes, and… Each time I see a Vblock go into service I am profoundly aware that this is where unleashing innovation begins and makes it a more yes, and… world.       ","categories": ["VCE"],

        "excerpt":"  Yeah, you need new business cards – A peer of mine 4 or 5 titles ago You’ve perhaps seen me at events or seen my content in other places or on my public blog or Twitter, etc… and that’s been great. What I’ve lacked in frequency here on the old bloggity blog I hope to make up for soon… starting by purposely NOT doing a 2011 Recap/Top Stories/Year in Review. [ So, here’s the double redacted pseudo-cryptic secret spilled finally about what I’m doing now… (Hint: It’s the title of this post) I’m hoping to be around these parts a bit more now in my new (slightly more formalized) role as Evangelist for strategic sales in Global Service Providers (SP) and Systems Integrators (SI) at VCE. This is my sixth or seventh title within VCE but it’s always been a part of my day to day duties. I’m still as passionate as ever about helping companies realize the dream of ubiquitous workload substrates in their datacenters: Vblock Infrastructure Platforms. [ So… What’s new? For 2012 (and frankly right now!) the following areas are where I’ll focus for the Vblock ecosystem:       VCE Strategic Accounts         VCE Executive Briefing Center (EBC), Cisco EBC, EMC EBC, VMware EBC, and VCE Technology Alliance Partner EBC         VCE Customer Advisory Board         Speaking and representing VCE for SP/SI events with VCE Marketing         Champion for SP/SI specific initiatives   Put another way… I get to put on hats of many shapes and sizes working with the most amazing teams one could ask for.       Evangelist for strategic sales in SP/SI with VCE Strategic Accounts customer meetings         Representative for strategic sales along side VCE Corporate Engineering (seriously… uber mega rockstars galore) at EBCs, CABs, etc.         Speaking and representing VCE for SP/SI at public events through VCE Marketing at trade shows, road shows, etc.         Embed with Cisco, EMC, VMware teams in SP/SI specific offerings such as VMDC, PMDC, HCS, UC, Puppet, NMS, SAP, Cloud Foundry, etc.         Collaborate with VCE Technology Alliance Partners on SP/SI specific offerings from APPTIO, ASTARO, CA TECHNOLOGIES, COLLABNET, INFOBLOX, INFORMATICA, LIQUIDWARE LABS, NIMSOFT, SAS, SCIENCELOGIC, UNIDESK, VISUAL NETWORK SYSTEMS, XANGATI, etc.         Create SP/SI specific social media content like this blog and other internal blogs, Twitter, YouTube, SlideRocket, Google+, Friendster, etc.   [ That sounds like a lot of stuff and overuse of etc. so what do you bring to the table? _Do you need someone from VCE that has been around a while and gets it? _I’ve been with VCE for well over a year. That makes me 85 years old in VCE years. I get it. I know a bunch more like me…. WE get it. _Do you need the goto place for something that is VCE or Vblock specific? _Ping me. I’ll get it for you or find someone smarter that will. One stop shopping. Fast and easy delivery. Hmm… that sounds FAMILIAR.

        "title": "Wired on Cloud",
        "excerpt":"[ I’m on vacation today. Yes, it’s awesome. I even got to play Beer Santa! After dropping off some holiday cheer, I scrolled through my Twitter stream and I came across a tweet from Kevin Kelling aka @BlueShiftBlog regarding a cloud article. Interestingly, the article was from… Wired. Yes. Wired. Yes. That Wired. Over the River and Through the Woods to Cloud Computing We Go In the Wired article by @jonst0kes (with a 0) there are references to Moore’s Law, workloads, bursty things, and that demmed elusive Pimpernel… the public cloud. You should check it out too. We’re going to be seeing cloud taken apart in a lot more consumer web blogs and non-traditional IT coverage blogs now. What is yet to be determined in all things cloud is the level of dismantling and elemental economic review associated with the latest consumer device being dissected with a running tally of part costs via kit alone. SPOILER: It’s not always about just the kit. Having read through this article a few times (it has paragraphs and stuff) I have determined I need to write a blog post. Yes. Friday Fudge style.  The Dude   Something has been bothering me about cloud computing for two years now Me too man. It’s like a new shirt that you forgot to wash and it is really scratchy. Annoying, am I right? It’s also like when people try to compare the credit card pay as you go bring your own chaos monkey (BYOCM) service to one where you enter into a workload tuned SLA backed contract with performance penalty clauses.  The Villain   Cloud services don’t drop drastically in price the way that transistors do If only we can keep people thinking the cloud is synonymous with INCREASINGLY FREE BEER! Then our trap will have been successful! Yes, please assume that everyone and everything fits into the generic public cloud! Let’s be sure to make it seem that statements made on a stage regarding software applications younger than 1 year old adequately represent what 99.9% of all companies on the planet do today across all their lines of business ARE COMPLETELY LOGICAL AND WITHOUT FLAW. It is perfectly reasonable to just speak in absolutes and subscribe to hyperbole!  The Biker   The problem arises when the overlap between what the public cloud supplies and what a customer needs is fairly narrow. Look man… this cloud stuff is going to be about a lot of things over the next 3-4 years but what it won’t be about is a specific reference to any single infrastructure company or player. We’re in the early days. Just like this consumer web thing that spawned 10429 ways to share photos and post it to Twitter, Facebook, and a zillion other places – saying we don’t need another photo sharing app doesn’t mean we need don’t need another cloud company. We just need to know which ride is our ride right now and which ride is our ride tomorrow… and how much it would cost to add some bichin’ spider lights.  The Barber   The downside to the “outsourced heavy lifting” aspect of cloud comes when you don’t have a whole lot of heavy lifting to do, at which point you’re subsidizing someone else’s heavy lifting. The weather is a funny thing you know? Just looking back a year ago it seemed like nobody was going to contain what cloud was and wasn’t. Now, it seems we are all bent on sticking cloud into a box. Hah! No pun intended! I tell ya… one thing is for sure – there is going to be clouds. Big. Small. Tall. Short. Fat. Skinny. Decaf. All of it is good. All of it is disruptive. It’s not so much about the horse race but where the primary race venues are to be found: locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally… and the entry fees.  The Bland   companies are much more excited by private and hybrid cloud models than they are about the public cloud Pundits will continue to isolate and refine specific definitions and attempt to draw on historical trends as a basis for extrapolation – often in a contrived zero sum game. This is not new. What is new is the creative destruction of what has previously been an accepted method of satisfying workload requirements – dedicated one off silos of physical infrastructure. So while the notion of a_ service provider might sound quaint or Orwellian depending on your point of view, the end goal of the enterprise team both large and small is to do more with less and increase satisfaction to the end user. That means moving towards _internal service provider _models and making things happen in ways end users often think of as being available _only externally. In fact, it can be both and we’re on a road that takes us there. ","categories": ["friday fudge","VCE"],

        "excerpt":"Hello 2012. Let’s rip the cover off this one! Today begins my two week experiment of life without public social media. Say what!?? No Twitter. No Foursquare. No Google Plus. No Instagram. No Path. No Linkedin. No Tumblr. No Flipboard. No Flickr. No YouTube. No TinyReview. No LiveJournal. No Diaspora. No… you get the picture. (I’m not leaving Facebook out… I just don’t use it.) Okay. Now what? Instead of using public social media resources, I’ll be focused on 100% behind the corporate firewall(s), CIDR restricted, Shib/PL/RSA/etc. protected and otherwise Enterprise only class forms of private and hybrid social media. What I’ve noticed now that I get to interact daily with a decidedly non-public facing non-publically consumable stream of raw sensitive information is this: Tightly aligned, low friction, reasonably secured sharing is key. Requiring a dozen or more places to consume/share/interact is tantamount to making busy people just move on without you. What does private and hybrid social media look like?

        "title": "Emerging Patterns",
        "excerpt":"Don’t look behind the curtain if you want the magic show to be magic Since my last update there have been a number of developments on personal and professional fronts. Most of this post was done tapping away on my laptop somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean. Or maybe it was the Pacific Ocean. Either way, it occurred to me that if I don’t put this down in writing I’ll wonder what I was thinking when I look back on this time. [ First, I am now Uncle Jay. When I typed up this post I had not met my niece since I’ve been traveling non-stop for work. I knew almost immediately when she was born. I’ve seen her in photos. The way I found out was through the wonder of globally compatible mobile telecommunications networks supporting the SMS, MMS, and IP stacks that allowed my iPhone to allow me to be party to the event – albeit virtually. Thanks Cloud! Now that we’ve met it is safe to say that I’m looking forward to even greater duties as Uncle Jay. Second, since my last update I’ve been hopping around the world in my new global role at VCE. This includes hops to Sydney Australia and London England with stateside visits in the middle Boston and Atlanta. My brain is holding up well considering the potential for jet lag. Partly, this is due to planning ahead so that 24-48 hours before these trips I’ve adjusted my own hours to map to the destination. Third, while I feel healthy, I’m still concerned about my weight and realize that I have to change up my patterns and work tendencies. Seating on domestic flights is a reminder that I’m taking up far more than my required share of what this world has to offer. Knowing many folks around me in my age bracket having health issues is a wake up call as well. I need to pay myself first and get past this. [ And so a pattern emerges My travel has been draining but it is required for what VCE and VCE customers demand – excellence. It’s fair to say that all the naysayers, haters, and pundits are a bit shocked by just what VCE has accomplished in such a short time. Being on the inside there is a certain amount of reflection I can make going back to 2010. Fast forward to the present and there are still a great many more things to refine, hone, and fashion into the precision operation this global transformation requires. Within the industry, there are alignments taking place. You can see this when you see a strategic pairing of companies to address a perceived market demand. By definition, technology is the response to a perceived need whereas science is that which explains and predicts with periodic refinement through the vetting and promotion of paradigms. Within this model of delivering readily consumable services, platforms, and infrastructure that most folks call cloud there is a clear pattern emerging. This pattern is increasingly regular and repeatable. [ Rugs and Carpets If you’ve ever marveled at the elegance and unique qualities of a oriental rug you know they are complex and beautiful. They are highly prized hand crafted works of art to many and they are associated with a sense of style – perhaps a style that is timeless in nature. On the other hand, the modern technology that has brought about a wide world of carpeting means that anyone can cover the largest imaginable plate in a seemingly endless footprint. The difference here being the look is an emphasis on uniformity and consistency that can be replicated and applied in a variety of situations. Unique traffic resilience adds to the longevity of the solution but with an understanding that newer carpets can always be easily put into service as whims and budgets allow. And still… there are carpet remnants that can cover just enough of a floor. What an amazing set of choices one has available in these modern times. [ The Installers Have Arrived There is a jingle I recall from my childhood diet of cable television: Five Eight Eight… Two. Three Hundred… Empiiiiiiiire. With all apologies to Queensryche fans, the Empire jingle is one I can hear in my mind even now as I type the word. What I like to think about when it comes to Vblock is the realization of ubiquitous workload substrate. Just roll them in like carpet. Then arrange whatever workload on the Vblock you want. Mix and match those workloads. Shift them around like so much furniture to find your Feng Shui arrangement of applications and changing demands. ","categories": ["VCE"],

        "excerpt":"[ It’s that time again. SxSW is my annual pilgrimage or it has been since 2008. This year will be the first one where I’m not ‘working’ it because this time I am taking – yes – a vacation. While the notion of a massive tech convention might not seem like a vacation, this is me we are talking about, right? If you are attending SxSW and use the SxSocial service my profile is at this lovely URL: http://sxsocial.sxsw.com/users/39361   @Percival #prediction a changing of the guards for SxSW, new folks outweigh regulars, 50% less binge drinking, 50% more badgeless options   – Jay Cuthrell (@qthrul) February 25, 2012 For those of you doing math at home, SxSW 2012 is my fifth SxSW. It all started with tacos.   For those of you following me, my tweets from March 8-14 will 100% SxSW vacation powered. plancast.com/qthrul You. Have. Been. Warned.   — Jay Cuthrell (@qthrul) March 5, 2012 I’ll be adding notes here or in another post as they come to me.  I’m really excited to see folks speaking from Cisco, EMC, and VMware this year at SxSW. In addition, there are some selections I’ve already made just based on the buzz and synopsis portions of the fancy new SxSW schedule builder. For an idea of what I’m going to attempt to attend here’s a small preview from my personal SxSW schedule builder:   My SXSW schedule so far… schedule.sxsw.com/2012/user_even… What is yours?   – Jay Cuthrell (@qthrul) March 3, 2012 [This year I’m only going to be attending SxSW Interactive from March 8-14. Again, I will be out of office and soaking up the knowledge and connections that only SxSW can provide. So, wait… why do I do this each year? First, I try to make myself scarce and truly disconnect from work during this pilgrimage – and this is a relative function of business of course. When I was a consultant prior to joining VCE, SxSW was where I closed deals. I expect this trend can continue as VCE focuses on PaaS and SaaS markets. SPs today are already dipping their toes into innovation centers and SxSW is where a lot of those ideas are spawned. You get to talk with these folks at SxSW – often over beers, tacos, or people that have fallen over from too many beers and tacos. Second, I hope to visit the SP and SaaS companies as I did in 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Many of these companies invited me to their panels at various trade events (great times for an all things Vblock chat eh?). In a nutshell, you’ll see various SP’s attending and an update on the latest SaaS and technology envelope plays. SxSW is about the absolute edge of the envelope for cloudy type stuff. Getting to hang out with folks that are the applications leadership/development teams and letting solid connections form is rewarding, fun, and why I’m here. Third, this is about visibility. This year there are SxSW speakers from EMC, VMware and Cisco. While I won’t be speaking, I’ll be attending interactive panels, discussions, and be skating along with others where the puck will be. That’s my plan. I’m sticking to it. At least until I get a DM about breakfast tacos.

That point in time is now. [box]Abstract: So, I’m at SxSW for my fifth year. Time for a little departure from short form here on the Google Plus bus… this isn’t something I’d put on my blog per se but maybe I’ll copy it over later and Google Plus as a glorified and severely limited WYSIWYG for notes.[/box] SxSW 2012 I was on the fence about going to SxSW again if I’m being completely honest with myself. Why was I on the fence? Partly it is due to the cost. When I say cost is not really about the money – I saved up for this. Rather, it’s the cost of drifting away of the dreamy experience I had in 2008. That it is SxSW. That cost is the cost of fond memories. The last thing I wanted to be is the guy that says “oh, it was so much better back when” and I’m not saying that at all. I’m just saying it is drifting away from what I expected or anticipated it might be. Does it matter? No. SxSW, like anything in life, can be exactly what you make of it. The SxSW experience need not have a badge, hotel, etc… it can be entirely couch surfing or entirely corporate funded Spring Break with hookers, blow, and the whole shooting match. Where you fit on the end points is a determination worthy of pause and careful consideration. http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcuthrell/6973716117 I’ve already run into the people I was expecting to see. I’ve already had a chance to see other brand new people coming in with wide eyed enthusiasm. I’ve had free drinks. I’ve had free food. I’ve slept well. I’ve enjoyed my vacation. The 6 or maybe 7 sessions I attended in their entirety were ones I wanted to attend out the hundreds offered by the schedule that only SxSW can put together. The sheer depth of the catalog is dizzying… until you look closely. Closer examination would should that there is simply more heft per category. Curious about those? Here: http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/user_events/user_39361 I’ve worn a suit this week to offset how I’ve dressed at prior SxSW – see also: sloppy. A suit? Yes. That’s right. I’ve dressed like this was a professional conference. Oh, the looks you’ll get in a suit. Did I anticipate that? Of course. I’ve already seen Bruce Sterling – in a futurist and historian solo talk respectively. This is considered to be an omen of being part of the right tracks for me. You see, the latest UX/UI machinations of a startup that won’t survive (reality folks) to see the next SxSW isn’t exactly my cup of tea. And going to anything like this is about finding your cup of tea. By the way, I don’t drink cups of tea. Parties are truthfully the one thing I’ve avoided this year and I’ve been nice and sober my entire stay. I’ve been able to observe. I’ve been able to articulate my thoughts. I’ve also been able to avoid standing in lines for an hour in hopes that something cool is inside once I get there. From experience, the cool is where you are standing. You can be your own party no matter where you go… just add people. The booze is entirely within the YMMV arena. http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcuthrell/6831698204 As an aside, Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts just dropped off a fruit bowl and water for me as a gesture of the key card issues I’ve had this week. Class act all the way. Hand signed note. NOT A TWEET. Hand signed note. Seriously. I’ve been asked what parties I’m most excited to go to. I’m really not excited about any parties. I’ve been there. I’ve done that. Has a new form of booze been invented? No? Okay, I’m good then. I’m turning 40 this year. I’m not saying I’m starting to act my age but perhaps, just perhaps, I’m starting to act like myself (again). (side note: The fact that I’m able to reference both Bruce Sterling Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts in a Google Plus posting is glorious present / future dissonance) https://plus.google.com/110357001884194145645/posts/PcZzdzs12tq ","categories": ["SxSW","VCE"],

I’ve noted the difficulty of pointing to materials or opining on materials without breaking embargoes or stealing thunder going into major VCE and/or VCE parent company announcements. But hey… that’s cool. This place is awesome. I’ll just blog about other stuff or I’ll just keep tweeting and posting YouTube videos :wink: http://twitter.com/qthrul/statuses/188418587537584128 Looking Back. Looking Forward. When I joined VCE in 2010, for a brief moment in time, I had met or interacted with just about everyone in the company by early 2011. That was easy when you had a few hundred folks more or less located in a few places, regular WebEx/TelePresence cadences, and a goal to grow like mad. Good times! Of course, today we are a much larger group of folks and span the entire globe. I’m not new to hyper growth but still… what a ride. When I would tell folks about this little startup company called VCE they would ask who the investors were and if we were growing. I’d mention Cisco, EMC, VMware, and Intel and that we were growing. (This is usually when they just stare at me and say) ”Startup, eh? Sounds like an already running!” Now, one of the common questions I get is “Who are you hiring and where are you hiring?” My response is also common: “People that want to ride the rocket! Everywhere!” Selfishly, I want everyone to find their inner Unicorn Jockey but presently the listings are being filled and/or created faster than the import processes published online. For example, if you’ve ever looked around for VCE on Linkedin in the jobs section you’ll notice that many of the listings are “red hot” now. What do I mean? A recent VCE jobs posting in Research Triangle Park, NC on Linkedin looks like this: [ Again, that’s just one example though. So, let’s take a look at who we are looking for and where we are looking. Generally speaking, the following roles come up often when I think of the team and where we are growing:       Software Engineers         Implementation Architects         Client Solutions Directors         Customer Advocates         Account Managers         vArchitects   For example, in the Americas you’ll see roles where we have our larger offices       Dallas (HQ)         Boston         Research Triangle Park, NC         Santa Clara         London         Cork   As you might expect, VCE is also growing teams globally so there are listings at various locations around the world       Singapore         Bangalore         Sydney         Tokyo         Sao Paulo         Phoenix         San Francisco         Washington DC         New York         Los Angeles         Hamburg         Munich         Frankfurt         Stockholm         Paris         Switzerland     Here’s a snippet similar to my last post over at Hacker News on the topic:   VCE is always looking for developers with a passion for accelerating the adoption of converged infrastructure that is simple, effective, and always available. We have developers shipping stuff that is already making huge impact in datacenters around the world and we are growing those teams aggressively. The keyword soup is spec docs, object models, class diagrams, state flows, Subversion, Jenkins, Agile/Scrum, ESB, Hadoop, Pig, Puppet, Chef, Java, C, C++, Perl, Python, RESTful, XML, GWT, iPhone, iPad, etc… etc… So, if you want to get an inside leg or if you have any questions drop me a note and your CV at jay.cuthrell@vce.com Subject: HN(if you get an OOO response don’t worry I’ll reply) ","categories": [],

Tech blog posts appear before the coffee carts are removed. Conclusions and predictions are posted at the speed of light. Fascinating. Indeed, these are long tech blog posts that say what folks must be thinking. There are fully worked out scenarios outlining explicit details and actions that must be taken by companies and their leaders per the social contract of the development community. Yes, these long tech blog posts are the blueprints for the solution. There are examples where those tech blog writers aren’t even in attendance. These tech blog writers are just that good, that tuned in, and that hip to the low down of it all. Fascinating. As such, I’m starting to recommend that folks disconnect from any tech blog that uses the following conventions in any post.   horse race metaphor  physical violence metaphor  hyperbole (all of it)  all internal links  war references (any and all of them)  blatant refusal to use proper terminology  consistent rivalry references  catering to irrational fears  writing about writing about writing (potentially about writing)But I like reading the tabloids Okay. Sure. It’s a guilty pleasure. We’ve all been there. So, let’s make a deal. For a week (or two), stop reading anything that has exhibited the prior list of things to watch out for. See how that feels. We’ll call this our little A/B test. This is not a veiled GTD experiment. This is a cleansing of the impurities that build up from a steady diet of tech blog coverage. For the test, the general time collection method is simple. Determine the total time you normally spend on tech blog X, Y, and Z… use browser plugins or just guestimate if you are into that concept. Otherwise, how does 30 minutes sound? Tech Blog Free Diet Monday: Determine the tech community project you care the most about and engage in that community to see what is going on or spend more time you’d normally spend there Tuesday: Do not read anything. Instead, organize your bookmarks and wonder why you saved them in the first place. Crazy, right? Wednesday: Find two projects on Github, Google Code, SF, LP, or Codeplex, etc. and follow something or make a comment if you can Thursday: If you use Twitter, only share links to the two projects you found on Wednesday, say it is awesome or worth checking out and tag it #blogaboutit Friday: Determine what your favorite is, find out who the top 10 committers are, and send number 7, 8, 9, and 10 a personal thank you note if you can find them online easily. ALL THESE TECH BLOGS ARE YOURS EXCEPT TECHMEME. ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE. Remember, this A/B experiment is our little secret. Perhaps, just like the rise of meta summary curating services, there will be a community scale expansion that buries things not worthy of being read by folks regardless of where it is published or the SEO melange that pushes it to the top spot of seemingly arbitrary lists.

        "excerpt":"Life moves pretty fast when you are traveling for work. I’ve come back from each trip to learn that the VCE RTP office is growing by leaps and bounds. My last trip took me to the VCE Boston office for a customer meeting and EBC. Since taking a global role I’ve been spending a lot of time meeting with customers around the world. Sometimes that involves travel and using Cisco TelePresence. The use of Cisco TelePresence is a lot less wear and tear on your life and I’ve been fortunate enough to enjoy such global sessions with Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, etc… and back in the US it makes it easy to be everywhere and anywhere at just about anytime people are awake. I’m very fortunate to be working for VCE at a crucial time in the growth of the company. It’s good to take a step back and look at where you’ve been and look ahead to where you will be. Here are few of the photos I’ve snapped while visiting Singapore, Tokyo, London, and Sydney. In between these trips I’ve been all over the US too and it’s only May. I hope to visit with customers in Brazil and Israel later this year. It’s been 10 years since I’ve been back to both but I’m looking forward to seeing Rio and Tel Aviv again soon.

        "excerpt":"[digs VCE office in RTP. This is exciting for a host of reasons but the growth of VCE is remarkable. When I look back on the series of posts I’ve put up here there has been a consistent trend of riding the rocket ever higher as an organization. It’s more than just a bigger office or more offices. It’s the whole vibe. One of the concerns in any startup is the notion of culture and how that culture is shaped. You grow. You add to the mix of people, new customers, new directions, and new technology shifting with the hope of forging a culture that sustains and provides for innovation. Sometimes if you are lucky you get to see this first hand. I think I’m pretty lucky. I’m coming up on my two year mark with VCE. The folks that have been here longer than me have a perspective that I get to hear about from time to time. The new folks that just arrived are perspectives I get to hear about more and more as we grow. Seeing VCE through the eyes of those that came before me and those that have a front row seat to the future of VCE is hard to put into words but I think I can summarize it as a vision of hope and a runway that extends far enough to launch whatever we can dream up and dare to deliver.  Related to that… I’ve also taken on a new role within VCE. Again, as is customary, my title and role changes and I rotate to learn more and be humbled by the folks around me on a regular cadence. This time I’m happy to announce I’ve been added to the Office of the CTO at VCE. Yes, that’s right. I’m (back) on Team Trey. [that talk a bit more about the VCE perspective on a variety of topics. I’ll still be putting up my personal experiences at semi-random update intervals but my focus will be to publish early and often about all things VCE. My experience in cutting off all public social media at the beginning of the year has crystallized how I’ll approach this new element of my work day. [ For example, as I am tapping out this post I’m at Cisco Live US 2012 in San Diego meeting with customers, Cisco teams, and VCE folks that I’ve only known from emails, instant messages, WebEx sessions, and TelePresence. The announcements from Cisco and the VCE story during this Cisco event have been exciting to say the least. We even managed to pull off a massive tweetup with teams from EMC and Cisco this week. I’m looking forward to deeper dive posts about how VCE is approaching and utilizing Cisco technologies like OTV along with EMC VPLEX and what it means for VCE partners and customers. Additionally, contrasting the paths to the right solution at the right time ranging from component Build Your Own to VSPEX to Vblock. In fact, I was able to do a video segment with Shashi Kiran from Cisco and Parmeet Chaddha from EMC this week on just that topic. Where else have I been? As I indicated in my last post a month ago, I was happy to get a chance to visit Brazil once again. This time I headed down to Rio for the CIO Latin America Summit to present on the topic of the VCE view on where the datacenter and our industry in general is headed. It’s not often you get to present in front of dozens of CIO’s so I was humbled to have the opportunity to do so. Also, being able to catch a sunrise in Rio is always a rare treat. [ Right before Rio I had back to back visits to Las Vegas for Interop and EMC World for customer meetings. If you follow me on Instagram, Path, or Flickr you’ll see some of my image captures in my travels. I’ve been experimenting again with Tumblr for things like putting specific videos that I “add to Favorites” on YouTube, or photos posted to Flickr passed through a simple ifttt.com task to shove them into Tumblr as a video post. My Twitter updates that contain a URL are pulled into Delicious using ifttt.com as well. Flickr images are pulled in from Foursquare (via Path) or Instagram using, again you guessed it, ifttt.com so it’s a good way to keep up with where I’ve been and what I’ve captured along the way. [ I also managed to fit in a few trips to the West coast to the coast of NC.  After Cisco Live wraps this week I’m also looking forward to Omaha VMUG, customer visits far and wide, any my speaking series through the remainder of the year. I’ll continue the use of Plancasts, TripIt, and the embeds on the sidebar here to give anyone ample time to keep up with me and where I’m headed. Let’s connect! GAMEON!!! ","categories": [],

        "title": "Thinking About Innovation",
        "excerpt":"As of this post I’m almost halfway through my speaking series and workshops on the topic of innovation for NTCA companies. I’m speaking to board members, GMs, key personnel, and the occasional vendor along the way.  Just a few weeks ago I fortunate to present in Rio at the CIO Latin America Summit 2012. The topic at that CIO event was innovation and I presented using SlideRocket which is now my go to deck creation service of choice.  The CIO event was a timely trip and I was able to work through what I was exposed to in Rio as I’ve traveled to NTCA events San Antonio and Hilton Head. Each time my opening remarks and the topics I address have been refined both in terms of my keynote presentation for NTCA companies as well as the workshops afterwards. A few questions I’m addressing at my talks are simpler ones: \tWhat does it take to get in a state of mind where innovation flows?\tHow does one make innovation a systematic embedded process in the organization?A few questions I’m hoping I address are more complex ones: \tWhere is the puck going to be? (i.e. the future of telecom) \tWhat does it mean to be a service provider of relevance?Of course, when you are thinking about the future it can be daunting or exhilarating depending on your approach to the process. I’ve tried to stay high level and avoid the pitfalls of a purely technical talk and referencing the latest whiz bang gadget on the horizon. Also, the time afforded on stage could easily put a large group to sleep so I’ve attempted to mix up the format and flow into chunks of roughly 15-20 minutes per theme. In fact, much of the material I pulled together for IP Possibilities 2010 and subsequent talks in 2010 are still pertinent and holding up well with age. For example, my decks relating to private cloud are still tracking nicely with the market moves. I’m also aware of my active roles before and after these decks were created. In my talks at NTCA events this year I’ve opted for SlideRocket instead of SlideShare since it’s a great platform for the kind of series specific materials and regional updates I’ve been making. For all of my talks I’ve been making reference to some YouTube videos that I’ve found to be enjoyable on the topic of innovation. Some of them are short. Others go well beyond the threshold of 20 minutes. Here are a few that I’ve made reference to: ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Long days. Long nights. Long flights. It’s been a while since my last update. To say I’ve been busy within the Office of the CTO at VCE is a bit of an understatement. Busy having a blast. Lately, I’m checking out how more often occurrences of VCE and Vblock appear in headlines or as a reference somewhere within tech blog posts on the blogosphere. It’s interesting to see what was below the radar begin to show up a bit more now. Granted, some of the things I search for are niche or less intuitive but it’s fun to see what comes up in research. I was searching with a new service launched by the folks behind bit.ly called realtime that gives me a peek into even lesser shared articles out there that wouldn’t be found otherwise. [ Side by side testing of realtime against even Google was impressive since it let’s you mask a search to, say, Linkedin, Facebook, or Twitter, etc… in a word? Brilliant! What’s more interesting is just how completely off some of the more obscure references are that show up in my queries. Having been with VCE since 2010 I’ve come to the conclusion you can’t make this stuff up. Comedy gravy. For example, an IBM oriented blog that earlier this month indicated… well… here:   Thus far, you might be thinking that the PureFlex System is the only platform for running SAP. ITG addresses that too. Other vendors are out there. Oracle and HP have some solutions that have not gained much traction in this area. The VCE consortium has attacked the SAP environment more aggressively, however, the ITG illustrates significant advantages in the PureFlex Systems including breadth of support and system integration. Probably even more important is that with VCE, you are dealing with three companies in the consortium. Who owns the vision and long term strategy? When you are investing in an enterprise level solution you want the confidence that your single solution provider owns the future of the product. Not even Rome could be ruled with three emperors! Traction? Three companies? Consortium? Three emperors? [ looks in closet to see if toga is on a hanger ] A few points that come to mind…       The author is clearly confused.         The author is projecting regarding The Emperor’s New Clothes.         VCE is a company with investors that include Cisco, EMC, VMware, and Intel.         VCE and Vblock™ Systems are doing incredible things with SAP for customers.         See last point.   In fact, VCE produced a video detailing benefits to SAP customers that use Vblock Systems. So let’s try using that simple instructional video to bring a bit of clarity regarding how VCE and Vblock™ Systems are doing incredible things with SAP for customers. Speaking of YouTube videos… When it comes to companies like HP, IBM, etc… let’s just say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. GAMEON! ","categories": ["VCE"],

        "excerpt":"Yeah. I turned off comments. You see, I was a participating fan of them for many years. I was prolific. I commented anywhere and everywhere I could. I watched as comment forms evolved, expanded, rose, fall, soared, and failed. [ Ah, the disclaimer by qthrul In the history of my own blog experiments there were times when I would test out comment systems. Often, these were enhancements to Wordpress comments.  Over time the shift to a stand alone commenting environment occurred when companies like Disqus, IntenseDebate, LiveFyre, and pre-pivot versions of Echo made it possible to move the conversation to just about anywhere. The so-called NASCAR problem of how to maintain the pseudo-non-repudiation side of things was always interesting. It started with Gravatar essentially grabbing the email address namespace as an anchor for identity. This was in stark contrast to the early hacked up Wordpress sites that become popular (see also code frozen lumbering teetering beasts prone to outages) where you could type anything that would fit in a web form text field. This ended with Facebook entering into the comments arena. Facebook comments kinda make me weep for humanity in general. Yahoo is there too but not as much so maybe I’ll look back one day and Yahoo will have fixed all that Facebook has done wrong. [ Blog Spam by qthrul So after a few more test runs and a review of the total comments ever received (no, I’m not ignoring comment spam uh… innovations) here on my own blog I decided that it was just silly to keep up with comments. In fact, I’ve even removed sharing options as of this post. I just don’t care about the social impact when there are many other ways to have it tracked and I am the one that has the web server logs (for now). Does this mean I’m moving from my current Linode DIY environment to something Tumblr-esque like I did when I moved from my own colo box to something in the public IaaS cloud? Well, not exactly now I guess. Maybe? Sure. I’m always curious to try something new to me even if others have been doing it only that way ever. There are folk that have never touched installation media. There are folks that have never connected or even put hardware together for their personal publishing desires. Does that make me a relic? Hardly. Maybe I’m interested in what might pass for PaaS to enable what I once considered in my post regarding Evernote a while back – and that’s what I’d call a growing option. Never having to run OS updates again has a certain appeal. ","categories": ["VCE"],

Voting takes place over the course of 5 days August 20, 2012 to August 24, 2012. [website. Below are the standard question list responses I’ve provided back to Jonathan Bryce. Jonathan is someone who I don’t think I have talked to since Interop for Rackspace’s King of the Apps judging at House of Blues last year. Here’t the thing… I’m not unique from anyone else in the industry in that I know a lot of Rackers and other folks involved in the OpenStack community. In my case this even goes back to folks that know me from my college days… that assure me I’ll never hold public office. I digress… :wink: Okay – my responses: Enjoy!   1) What is your relationship to OpenStack, and why is its success important to you and/or your company? What would you say is your biggest contribution to OpenStack’s success to date? I am a complete outsider to OpenStack but a fairer statement might be to say that I am a complete outside admirer. That said, I’m committed to the success of any innovation that furthers progress in converged infrastructure and especially in areas relating to management and orchestration ecosystems. I view management and orchestration ecosystems as being inclusive of formal ISV’s or in the case of OpenStack, community driven endeavors. Within OpenStack I see the promise of what is possible to accelerate timelines towards that end with the management and orchestration ecosystem for Vblock™ Systems. My contributions to OpenStack in the future – regardless of potential board involvement – will be to assist the OpenStack community in that manner.   2) Describe your experience with other non profits or serving as a board member. How does your experience prepare you for the role of a board member? I have contributed both time and monetarily to non profits and community driven endeavors and those disclosures are represented in the disclosure portion of my blog. My experience as a board member has been limited to customer advisory boards and technical advisory boards of commercial entities and those disclosures are also represented in the disclosure portion of my blog. I view the OpenStack Board of Directors as an opportunity to contribute my time and energies for the benefit of the OpenStack community.   3) What do you see as the Board’s role in OpenStack’s success? The OpenStack Board of Directors role in the success of OpenStack should center upon organizational concerns to identify, support, and provide succession planning for the core leadership team (the Office) for the OpenStack community. While any Board of Directors role discussion would include governance, for the sake of brevity, the Board’s role is to put the interests of the OpenStack community above their own.   4) What do you think the top priority of the Board should be during the OpenStack Foundation’s first year? The top priority of the OpenStack Board of Directors should be establishing the core leadership team (the Office) for OpenStack and set timelines and appropriate bylaws to support and ensure sustainable succession planning. So that’s me and my poing of view in a nutshell. If you are reading this and are part of the OpenStack community – please do vote even if it isn’t for me. Progress comes in many forms but it rarely stems from a posture of apathy and the status quo. To that end I’ve been attempting to make progress on this blog. I can’t imagine why… [ ","categories": ["VCE"],

        "title": "Three Paths",
        "excerpt":"I get a few recurring questions from time to time. :wink: When I look back in my sent folder or listen to some of my WebEx recordings I find myself answering these same questions with some degree of expansion on the theme and quite often a refinement on wording. In fact, much like the continuous integration approach to converged infrastructure we take at VCE – my answers are getting better. Then again, I’ve been accused of explaining how to build a clock when asked what time it is. So here are three of the regular questions I get and here are the respective answers that I draw upon depending on the audience and their proclivity for staying awake. :wink: **What should the industry know about VCE that it might not know already?** First and foremost, VCE is a tremendous success for our investors and is experiencing explosive growth in terms of customers, partners, and the talent pool we’ve attracted. To understand this success is to understand why VCE exists. VCE seeks to eliminate challenges that consume today’s data center resources by delivering the world’s best VMware experience on the world’s most advanced converged infrastructure product: Vblock Systems. VCE defined the converged infrastructure movement and is extending its lead just as other vendors that compete with our investors initiate efforts in this market. VCE customers depend upon VCE to efficiently run agile data centers that provide a competitive advantage along with VCE investor and VCE Partner technologies and solutions. **What value is VCE providing to Service Providers today and what is VCE’s ongoing strategy?** VCE Vblock Systems provide secure and predictable performance through pre-engineered, modular infrastructure that enables standardized processes and operations that make it permissible for a Service Provider (SP) to standardize on a converged infrastructure product that is adaptable and proportional to their own customer requirements. Vblock represents a product driven by the demand to have a trust and SLA as guiding principles so that the SP can achieve the fastest time to market while maintaining customer expectations with predictable and quickly repeatable scaling patterns. VCE is focused on SP solutions that address not only the unique internal IT requirements of the SP but also the consistent demand for revenue generating offerings and the infrastructure that supports those offerings. VCE is committed to promoting ever increasingly agile delivery with the SP environment by supporting the next generation of use cases and scenarios that Enterprise IT will demand in the coming years. VCE will accomplish this through continued innovation and refinement of our own VCE developed IP in addition to the judicious use and application of technology innovations from our investors and partners. **What is VCE’s position and opinion on reference architecture within SP environments and more generally in the market today?** VCE believes that there are three paths to converged infrastructure. First, there is a BYO piece parts approach where a customer can literally pick and choose each element that comprise a point in time converged infrastructure or create an amalgam of technologies that they can stitch together on their data center floor. For best of breed in these component choices there are obvious benefits to using EMC and Cisco for storage, compute, and network needs for VMware environments. The customer then tunes and refines this on their own or with the help of trusted partner as an iterative process doing their own regression testing across patches, move/add/change, and compliance both physically and logically. Second, there is the reference architecture approach such as EMC VSPEX where a more refined list of those elements are brought together with guidance from a major product supplier for a scenario or scaling pattern that worked at least once for one variety of workload or use case scenario. This reference architecture can then be extrapolated or interpolated so that a sized anticipated workload can reside on the assembled parts. The physical parts are then delivered by a channel and paired with professional services that provide for an on site logical build followed by ongoing contracted services or customer created regression testing across patches, move/add/change, and compliance both physically and logically. Third, and I should add that VCE has very strong opinions here, is Vblock. Vblock is a manufactured converged infrastructure product paired with ongoing pre-engineering and ongoing support from VCE as it applies to the lifecyle of the investment. It is also important to understand the mission criticial workload characterizations as well as mixed workload characterizations that VCE applies to Vblock with a focus on solutions. Vblock represents the fastest return on invested capital for the Enterprise IT buyer seeking a converged infrastructure. For the SP, Vblock represents a just-in-time approach to entertaining and winning deals while maintaining SLA with unparalleled investment protection and product efficacy though the Vblock product lifecycle. Long term, VCE sees Vblock as the future and VCE customers are realizing this future today. In fact, you can see and hear a similar complimentary point of view shared by Cisco’s Senior Director Shashi Kiran and EMC’s VP Partner Solutions Parmeet Chaddha as well as a summary by me at the end on YouTube.

        "title": "My Second Year at VCE",
        "excerpt":"  You are witnessing the transformation of an entire industry._ Pay attention. It will be faster than you think._ – VCE Deal Desk Mission Control Room Two years ago this week was my first day at VCE. The past year at VCE started off with a review of my first year at VCE. To keep things consistent I’ll follow a similar format for this anniversary post. I’m posting this one a bit ahead of time because I’ll be soaking up knowledge at OpenStack Summit 2012 in San Diego. So much for that plan. Grow and go My role has shifted more than a few times within VCE. Those shifts were ones I could see happening as VCE grew and I went into my second year knowing travel might be a bit more intense. Sure enough, my travel has been wide and often but this year really stepped up on the international front. Looking back on the past 12 months I’ve traveled all over the US to meet with customers. In addition, I’ve visited Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Germany is right around the corner. Before 2012 is over I’ll likely visit even more countries where customers have realized the benefits of Vblock Systems. While the travel have been exciting for me, seeing the success of VCE in terms of our customers, partners, and investors has been incredibly rewarding. Knowing folks that have been with VCE going back to Acadia and pre-Acadia days gives me a new sense of respect for their strength of will and their ability to see to this rocket ship soar. Each time I have a chance to meet new hires it reminds me where I started in this mix and I’m right back at a small meeting in Boston getting fitted for my new space suit. Last month I spent a day at the VCE office in RTP. The building was familiar to me when I visited it the first time a few months ago. One of the things that really stood out was the pair programming / extreme programming rooms. Those are going to be popular. I’m also delighted at the amount of meeting space and all the touch down spots for folks like me. It’s been several years since I had an office with a door and I don’t miss it. https://twitter.com/qthrul/status/248205003196624897 Last week I was in San Francisco again. Previously I had pondered why I’m not out there permanently. A few folks brought clarity via the Twitters and for that I am thankful. The wisdom of relocating for the sake of a larger airport is still interesting. In fact, I’m still working on living in five major cities in five years. It’s fun to have a side research project. Harder than you think [Just to segue for a moment… this is my blog. Mine. I’ve talked about VCE a bit here over the past two years. During this time, the outside coverage of what VCE is and what VCE does has also been on the rise. I wish I could say it was all positive and supportive of the mission of VCE – or at the very least, objective. I say I wish because I’ve learned a lot along the way. On the getting better each day front I think of the tech analysts. You see, the investment group analysts that I supported years ago are different from the tech analysts that are part of the subscription content world in that investment analysts are razor focused on financial impacts whereas tech analysts take a much wider view of indicators that (may) lead to financial impacts. Tech analysts typically have some variety of pulpit for publication and dissemination of their points of view and that might include a blog of sorts. Good tech analysts have a track record, lineage, and are well known. Very often the tech analysts have a serious background in technology or made the jump from technologist to analyst and with it an easily identified perspective and a track record you can query. As such, I’ve really enjoyed getting to know this group so that I might better understand their motivations, needs, and tendencies. To be clear, these tech analysts are not to be confused with so-called tech bloggers. https://twitter.com/qthrul/status/235214632770482177 So what do I mean by tech bloggers? Simple. Tech bloggers are folks tend to appear from nowhere and while they cover tech topics… the world of productized converged infrastructure is pretty specific. That means you have to be careful with tech bloggers. Why? Because the tech bloggers can really get things twisted if you are not extremely careful and deliberate in your message. Then again, even if you are extremely careful and deliberate in your message some of the tech bloggers… will still get it twisted. [When it comes to tech bloggers, there are probably some analogies to swimming that can be made. Some tech bloggers are gold medal winners that dazzle us with their insights and long form analysis that might make you wonder if they aren’t destined to become tech analysts one day. Others… yeah, not so much. You see, some tech bloggers swim in an ocean knowing full well they didn’t even have their badge for the deep end of the kiddie pool. Many of these same tech bloggers will have a limited horse race, hyperbolic, zero sum, or war motif vocabulary that they invariably use to bury the lead like the dead fish it represents in terms of thoughtful consideration, deliberation, and analysis. To put a fine point on it, it is the kind of tech bloggers that are always fixated on some kind of death watch. They won’t get it and it might be fair to say they don’t want to get it. With each year VCE has thrived it has become some kind of personal affront to these kinds of tech bloggers. For these reasons, the single most annoying thing I read these days is the occasional misinformed, poorly sourced, and outright lazy phone it in contrarian coverage when it comes to all things VCE as seen through the fog glazed spectacles of tech blogger wearing bright orange inflatable arm bands. If there were a handful of things I wish these tech bloggers and their editors would finally grasp it would fit into a short and sweet list:       VCE is a successful company in every metric that matters and our customers, partners, and investors know this to be true.         VCE customers are realizing the benefits of Vblock Systems over and over again.         VCE partners are committed to succeed with Vblock Systems to provide delightful and repeatable converged infrastructure experiences for customers.         VCE investors are committed to our success.   I know. Crazy right? :smile: ","categories": ["VCE"],

        "excerpt":"[ Having reflected on my second year at VCE the question of what to do next has been bouncing around in my brain. In fact, it’s probably more accurate to say where to go next. Oh the places you’ll see On Monday last week I gave the final in a series of five keynote talks on innovation for NTCA that took place all across the US. I drove across Minnesota to get from MSP to Brainerd and Gull Lake. The colors were popping. The crowd when I arrived to present was receptive and warm. Looking back on this keynote series it was truly an honor to be selected by NTCA and to have a platform to share my views on innovation and a bit about VCE. As soon as I left the stage there were a series of conversations taking place back at VCE on what and where I wanted to be next. The next series of conversations were about what country I’d be in next and when to support the next phase of growth at VCE. As I caught my flight to San Jose my mind was already made up but I still needed the details. On Tuesday the blur of work calls, WebEx, and research eased into the late afternoon. To relax, I attend a seminar in Silicon Valley powered by pizza and Diet Coke as speakers from Netflix, Google, and enStratus shared unique perspectives on a variety of domains from foundations to failures to the fantastical. By now emails were flying around relating to the details so that moved final discussions to mid-week. On Wednesday I worked out of the Cisco office in San Francisco. I was able to book my final travel details for trips to Spain and Saudi Arabia. By this point the trip to Germany was already starting to look like it could be handled locally. I was also rounding up contacts for other OCTO team members heading to APJC. In between I was able to walk around a disarmingly sunny San Francisco to find pecan pie. There’s just something about pecan pie that helps you think clearly. Well, that’s what I tell myself at least. That evening I shared my decision with VCE. I’m moving to San Francisco. On Thursday I found a place to live. That morning I put down a deposit, filled out paperwork, and gave my contact information to confirm it all on Friday.   Seriously. You can do that in San Francisco. I used this amazing new service called Craigslist. You should check it out if you get a chance. They just might be a big deal one of these days. [. On Friday morning I got confirmation that I could pick up keys when I get back to San Francisco. When I arrived at the event I managed to catch the end of the ATIS Reference Architecture overview and attend their Q&amp;A. After I took the stage, my presentation veered quickly to the topic of software defined data centers. To get there I started with a light overview of what software defined networking is part of that puzzle. There were several heads nodding in agreement in the room. After my presentation I realized that the speaker after me was going to devote his entire presentation time to software defined networking. I love it when things work out like that! That Friday night I took the redeye back to RDU on Southwest as the orange painted sky to my back illuminated the desert below. I took a short nap and I woke up to the sparse lights of North Carolina under low clouds. When I looked at the time I made the decision that going to Moogfest would not be half as fun as visiting Beaufort. Maybe next year, Moogest. The big questions So what’s the best part of moving to San Francisco? It’s a lot closer to Montana. Hah! I bet you thought I was going to say something about bacon. Nope! So what’s the roughest part of moving to San Francisco? If you were to ask me that as I was making the decision it would be the distance from Beaufort. Then again, there are these wonderful inventions called airplanes and this concept called vacation that I’ve been reading more about lately. Perhaps it won’t be that rough after all.

        "excerpt":"  VCE is all about riding the rocket while constructing and reworking that same rocket in real time. – VCE 101 [ Having just returned from trips to Barcelona and Saudi Arabia I can see 2012 has shaped up to be one of those so-called travel intensive years. I’ve experienced travel at this level before but not as international. That means a bit more time to reflect on flights that aren’t wifi enabled and watching more inflight movies than I can recall before grabbing extended naps. When I look back on the first meetings with VCE folks in 2010 the topic of how much travel was too much travel came up immediately. At the time I was clear that in my consulting practice it was easier to count the days I was not traveling. Everyone smiled and said that it wouldn’t be anywhere near that much travel. Back then I knew there would be demand for what VCE was doing and what it was planning on doing. What I didn’t know was that I’d be heading west in just over two years This is what I do. I get around. Every single trip has been this year has been to take meetings with customers – multiple customers and multiple meetings per day in most cases. VCE customers that have realized the benefits of Vblock Systems are an ever growing global list. The travel is pretty concentrated in terms of what is accomplished on each trip. There is the ground you cover in the room and the ground you cover beyond the room. It’s not uncommon that when I get to the meeting there is already a conference bridge, a WebEx, or a Cisco TelePresence session pulling together global rosters of VCE, Cisco, EMC, VMware, and customer teams. There is no off switch. We are all online. [If you blink you might miss something. It’s true. Looking through my various sharing channels I’m reminded of just how much information courses through our veins. Luckily there is a solid and growing team of really smart folks here. So I can’t help but smile when I see a reply, wiki edit, or sharing of something better than I was going to send. You can sense the Americas, EMEA, and APJC nature of it all like some kind of indexed histogram of intelligent and often quite humorous banter. The M&amp;A show continues. Any questions? This year has seen a lot of M&amp;A activity from VCE investors. Each time Cisco, EMC, or VMware makes a move there is undoubtedly going to be speculation online in hopes of generating page views or promoting some kind of horse race narrative. This is to be expected and it often requires I be ready to explain for the hundredth time what VCE is about and where VCE is going to the uninitiated, the curious, the contrarian, and sometimes… the curmudgeon. For example, when Cisco acquired Cloupia there was bound to be questions such as “Does this mean Cisco IAC is going away?” “Does this mean Cisco customers will use Cisco IAC or Cisco Cloupia?” “Where did I put my glasses this morning?” [The simple answer to the going away question is “no” but color is required to illustrate that not everything in the market is a horse race or binary system of 1’s and 0’s. As such, in the wider DCIM landscape ‘it depends’ is that most pesky of responses that requires education and presenting the background to capture goals, coverage areas, concerns, and any caveats. Cisco IAC is data center oriented to encompass “a range of implementations” involving converged infrastructure, bare metal OS, VMs, network endpoints, apps, etc. To contrast, Cisco Cloupia is razor focused on specific requirements ranging from converged infrastructure products like Vblock to reference architectures like VSPEX and FlexPod. Considering both Cisco IAC and Cisco Cloupia are API rich it’s also a good bet that you’ll see some of both (mixed and matched) as specific converged infrastructure operations and automation needs emerge and grow within enterprise and specific service provider environments. Of course, that’s just a Cisco example. I fully expect that M&amp;A will continue at a robust pace from all VCE investor angles and interests. In each instance VCE will highlight how we’ve been thinking about the future as it applies to each of our investor innovations be they organic, M&amp;A, collaborative, and ultimately interlocked. https://twitter.com/KendrickColeman/status/269106678295826433https://twitter.com/qthrul/status/269098532156350464 As always, we can only do our best at VCE to present a sane and logical statement… that raises discourse to… promote a… uh… https://twitter.com/barbelty/status/270803190289666048 https://twitter.com/krmarko/status/269169423934451714 Seriously?[ ","categories": ["VCE"],

        "excerpt":"imported manually via copy/paste from tumblr.com… 6 years later What’s interesting about Tumblr? For me it is something I played with after I played with Posterous and I never saw it as a platform to start from since I had already been dinking around with WordPress. I’ve created and deleted accounts on Tumblr many many times. This is sort of how I’ve treated Facebook over the years as well. I had been connecting to Tumblr via IFTTT but even that service has waned in appeal to me lately. I think that’s because apps have centered around getting a push menu in place vs. trying to be the sole destination. That means I can publish something as a shared item that goes to Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, and even Tumblr. This one? I’m doing it by sending an email to a hashed email address at Tumblr.com. I remember there were entire web publishing software companies predicated on this concept back in 1997. The more things change… the more they stay the same.

        "excerpt":" I was going through my spawling comments on the Interwebs and noticed my Branch and Medium accounts were still alive but from a time when the Twitter authentication account creation was quite dated.  I even came across two orphaned comment streams that are worth a revisit on Branch that serve to show just how fragile consumer web services can be. I added my content to a buffer and decided to move it back into a blog post of my own versus the growing places to dump thoughts. Unfortunately, I don’t see Branch or Medium as durable places for content or thoughts. You Don’t Have To Go Home But You Can’t Stay Here Let me explain. Previously, I used Medium to cut and paste one of my prior blog posts. On Medium the post got 35 views whereas on my personal and quite obscure website there has been hundreds of views for essentially the same content. Branch is probably worse since it invites longer form comments that are basically the size of a missive or quickly rattled off blog post. So, just like comments that have been lost like the sands of time… no thanks. Here’s to saving one such thought from the langoliers of the cloud. Burl Ives Workloads (The topic of cloud native workloads is a popular one in clouderati circles.) Porting aside, I’d argue there are “Burl Ives” workloads that will not get cloudy by virtue of purposeful inattention by ISVs, preclusive highly customized design choices, or otherwise premises / latency / isolation / legal / license / cultural / etc. oriented requirements. It does not preclude placement within some variety of ultra generalized x86 basis cloud (today) . It’s simply a question of how well it runs as measured against these concerns. Shops running “Burl Ives” workloads will never stop asking if it is permissible to get more cloudy. If it means enduring the legacy for another few seasons of market innovations to get there so be it. ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"“We are a mole on the back of the beast.” — me in an email sent 15 years ago when pondering a move to the West coast  I’ve been in San Francisco for a few months now. The actual number of days that I’ve been in San Francisco is much less due to travel, work, family, and good old fashioned vacation time spent in Montana. The fact that I can be in Montana in a few hours using Delta, United, or even Allegiant is pretty smooth even if there are blackout dates to work around. While in San Francisco, I’ve been able to visit EMC and Cisco offices in downtown San Francisco by walking. That’s what I like to call awesome. I’ll eventually get around to the other satellite offices in walking distance. Did I mention how awesome that is? I don’t miss my car and I really don’t miss trying to find a parking spot. I’ve just learned about a Cisco shuttle from San Francisco to Cisco campus that sounds like the Google shuttle. I’ll report back once I’ve got a handle on the ins and outs of that process. The timing and door to door aspect has appeal when I can’t afford to miss a morning meeting in Silicon Valley. Caltrain trips to Silicon Valley have been on time, uneventful, and delightfully peaceful so far. It’s not too bad if you are going to Palo Alto but there are still some gaps when you want to get to a meeting at EMC. Cisco is no problem. Light rail options and buses fill in the gaps. The best part about riding Caltrain from San Francisco is that the Creamery is right across the street. Hello pecan pie.  BART is still as good as it gets for to and from OAK and SFO. The fact that I can map out a route if I have luggage (rare) is nice. Technically, I could even BART an East Bay route to get to Cisco and EMC with those same gaps filled by light rail and buses. I hope to experiment more in the coming months as I am able. MUNI buses have been good in that they are two bucks. That said, my one trip to Tenderloin on a MUNI bus so far was delayed because someone experienced a theft then refused to let the bus driver continue until the bus driver called the police. I learned that walking can sometimes be faster than riding. Also, I was reminded that theft can happen just about anywhere in the big city. If I get in a pinch there is always TaxiMagic, Flywheel, and Uber. While I’ve heard good things about Lyft and other ride sharing services, I’m just not as socially graphed enough for that yet. Speaking of social graphs… My return to Facebook is mostly done. I expect being on Facebook again will assist with some of that social graph mapping. That said, I’m still treating Facebook as a place where it’s all out there and any notion of privacy or vagaries around information being protected is fantasy at best. As the saying goes… if the product is free… you’re the product. Still, value is relative and single sign on has some advantages for the lazy aspects of my dialog with here today gone tomorrow services. The sheer number of restaurants, bars, and related consumption options is impressive as expected by being in a city proper. So far I’ve been using Path, Foursquare Lists (really really good), and Facebook — in that order. Yelp is useless to me because the recommendations seem like a search through complaints more than kudos. Maybe that will change. Maybe not. I’ve not used Postmates yet but I have an idea of where I might use it. I’m quickly realizing AT&amp;T is spotty for calls and especially so with 3G data. My move to Verizon is in process. Lastly, the new look here on the blog is thanks to a migration from WordPress to OctoPress. I even found drafts I had not published for some reason. Cleanup continues. I even enabled Disqus again.

        "title": "Follow the Leader",
        "excerpt":"Take a phrase that’s rarely heard One of my favorite YouTube videos became a new source of inspiration for me. The lyrics and visuals are decidedly old school. As such, it can be fun to mix things up and think of how they can apply to recent events. Flip it Converged infrastructure, fabric based infrastructure, integrated infrastructure systems, and probably a few other phrases can be used to describe what I’ve been calling ubiquitous workload substrate for a few years now. So when I first found out that VCE was named by Gartner as the market share leader for integrated infrastructure systems, I knew it was only a matter of time before things got even faster and crazier than they were before. Things have always moved fast at VCE. The overall IT industry in both enterprise and service provider settings is being pulled from the past to the present. VCE is focused on pulling this industry into the future. VCE isn’t sitting still. VCE is all about riding the rocket while constructing and reworking that same rocket in real time. It’s probably no shock that VCE competitors would almost immediately launch into some kind of marketing conniption when VCE was named as a leader by a third party in this way. Yet, I’m still amazed that so many other companies claim to do the same thing as VCE and fall so short of the target VCE has created. Still, it can be less clear who the leader is when the market is being filled with overly broad use of terms or when a category is highly diluted through purposefully ignorant press coverage. This drive by phone it in approach to writing happens when various consumer web blog empires stray to the coverage of enterprise and infrastructure. Say, for example, a so-called tech journalist that covers the automobile industry trying to compare factory built automobiles to kit cars, bicycles, and skateboards – because both have wheels. Better yet, someone that sells skateboards becomes a trusted source for an audience that covers the market for automobile. Setting aside the desire to simply make wild claims, there is always an audience that will take the path of lazy or stupid and hit the publish button. The good news is that there are times when smart coverage makes the stupid coverage look, well, even more stupid. Now it’s a daily word There is a moment where a clear leader is easily identified in a market. When that leader emerges the moment can be short lived or the preview to market dominance in an ever increasing competitive landscape. Fact: VCE has been named the market share leader for integrated infrastructure systems by Gartner. This is not up for debate. (you know… a fact!) Opinion: Every other VCE competitor that is chasing after the same market will have to match pace and come at VCE on every front of the the Vblock™ System Support Experience and overall customer experience. Full stop. They have to. Otherwise, these VCE competitors are basically conceding one or more areas of the experience that VCE is superior. Being the leader in a market is also a curious state of being defined or categorized at a moment in time. Being known for leading something is not without peril. Words matter when there is a specific and unique occurrence that is being described for the first time and at the time of taking a leadership position. This is especially true in markets that are growing. Seems you’re stuck For example, I can recall working for companies in the past that claimed to own a specific market back in the late 1990s. It would go a little like this:   Company A realizes apples to apples comparison metrics put Company B in the leader position.  Company A then changes definitions and creates a new statistic that makes the numbers look more impressive.  The statistic, of course, meant absolutely nothing but now Company A is the leader.Pretty slick right? Wrong. The fallout comes later but looks something like this:   Company A customers didn’t know they were part of the statistic.  Company A customers saw through it.  Company B calls out Company A – typically in public forums, etc…  Company A backs away from using the statistic in future marketing.  Analysts covering Company A are even more merciless in hounding around those flubbed statistics when year over year growth doesn’t match future reporting of the numbers.Looking back, that market no longer exists today and many of those companies no longer exist as well. You have to have a direction and preside over your own destruction. It turns out you can go pretty fast in an automobile by putting it in neutral, rolling it down a hill, and eventually over a cliff. This would also apply to a skateboard. Hmmmm… Hurry hurry step right up Now that I’m on the West coast I’m looking forward to the new offices in Silicon Valley being a touch down for customer meetings. Being witness to phenomenal growth and continuous integration in our products and delivery capabilities has been delightful. There is often a horse race mentality or a zero sum game point of view when regarding markets. The less myopic view is to also consider the overall size of a market and the consideration of that market as being in expansion versus contraction. Here’s to the future. Can you name this tune? Speaking of the future… and in the spirit of adding another YouTube video to this post… It was a blast being part of the VCE team supporting one of our investors, EMC, and their amazing professionally trained dance troupe, the EMC Giddyups in this helpful instructional video. :wink: Rumors of my transition into a song and dance career are greatly exaggerated. You know, they say the camera adds 15 pounds… or in my case… 95 pounds or so! ","categories": ["VCE"],

        "excerpt":"It’s that time again. Since 2008, South by Southwest (SxSW) has been one of my annual professional pilgrimages. SxSW is where anyone in the infrastructure business should be to expand their understanding of what application developers and creative thinkers can do when infrastructure shifts one of four ways: \tthe potential \tthe possible \tthe available \tthe ubiquitousAs I have done since 2010, I am once again looking forward to SxSW 2013 and what I will bring back to discuss with the team here at VCE. I’ve previously spoken at SxSW on topics ranging from changing attitudes to email to collaboration stacks to realtime network intercept concepts. While I’m not speaking at SxSW this year, I will be soaking up sessions topics near and dear to my role here at VCE. My findings in prior years have been interesting when I look back on how things have turned out so far. South by What? Granted, if you are reading this blog post struggling to understand the role of SxSW or perhaps what SxSW is exactly, I’ll do my best to convey that. The way in which SxSW fits into the concerns of converged infrastructure might seem like a stretch, so please indulge me for just a moment… Every March, tens of thousands of geeks, nerds, and creative people descend upon the Austin to soak in the latest trends and emerging technology for what is arguably the biggest event in technology on the planet. SxSW is broken up into three specific tracks: Interactive, Film, and Music. It is the SxSW Interactive sessions which are the most relevant to the ongoing transformation taking place in IT today. SxSW Interactive is also, by far, the largest and most dominant element of SxSW each year since I’ve been in attendance. Over the years, I’ve noted that SxSW Film and Music also have sessions that focus on the technology side of those mediums. I always run into the application owners and stakeholders at various Enterprise companies, service providers, media and entertainment companies. Increasingly, these are the same people that are part of the unstoppable march of convergence. SxSW Interactive has been the indexing arbiter of all the things that have become common elements of modern consumer web and increasingly Enterprise IT challenges and trends. In the past, SxSW revealed trends and directions relating to consumer web to geolocation to what has most recently been coined as big data. SxSW Interactive is where the most bleeding edge attempts at viable (and not so viable!) business models emerge. This year at SxSW I’m expecting lots of big data, machine to machine, Internet of Things, and an increasingly Enterprise and devops oriented themes to emerge. As the saying goes – it’s not if but when. Increasingly, there are references to a purely Enterprise and devops audience at SxSW Interactive. Agile and innovation spring up now as assumptions instead of a purposeful tagging for a given session or topic. Granted, this did not happen overnight but SxSW Interactive will be where I draw inspiration and cement an awareness of what is coming in the next few years. In a nutshell, SxSW is where infrastructure professionals can get a rough idea of where the next great IT challenge is going originate. For example, past years proved the proliferation of personal mobile devices could not be ignored and the demand for whim based infrastructure was not fad. Focus SxSW Interactive 2013 will be the first time I will not be constantly updating my beloved geolococation, sharing, teaming, and collaboration apps of the moment. Those were fun. Having digested several failed and now successful brand names, their APIs, and expectations for use in a service provider and telecommunications context – it is time to shift focus. This year at SxSW Interactive, I plan to draw new inspiration and focus on Enterprise and what has been adopted today and what is bring proposed in the near future. As always, there is an implicit impact to service providers for any hybridization in IT delivery and IT consumption patterns. This will ultimately translate into a disruptive technology buffet for Enterprise. It’s going to be a very exciting future indeed. I expect a relentless assumption of infrastructure that is boring. I expect an even more relentless assumption that everything relating to getting developers productive on infrastructure is because it just works. Why? It’s time. First, the pace at which VCE has evolved is nothing short of amazing for the industry. Just consider how Vblock has helped transform the way in which VCE customers deliver IT. Second, changing how companies can consume IT and what service providers will use to assist in that transformation is fundamental. VCE has been recognized as the market leader for this reason. Delivering a new unit of IT was the first step. Allowing companies to realize ubiquitous workload substrate was the second step. Now it is time for the next step. Directions At SxSW in 2008, one of my favorite breakout sessions was a cloud computing meetup. While the topic was cloud computing the real discussion was how fast, repeatable, and viable it was to attempt consumption models behind the corporate firewall. That’s right. The talk was taking place primarily because of developments and trends that made it permissible to stand up these new IT consumption and delivery architectures in an inherently controlled environment. Some dubbed this private cloud. Others just kicked around the idea that mixing and matching private and public cloud resources were inevitable i.e. more blurring would occur. It was very apparent that virtual appliances with ready to use applications would be the norm regardless of being placed on premise converged infrastructure, hosted at a trusted service provider on converged infrastructure with an SLA, or in the public cloud with no SLA whatsoever. Just a few months that same year later I noticed that almost all of the companies I tracked in the space of software, stacks, and other systems administration intensive apps offered Open Virtualization Format (OVF). By the end of 2008 OVF was the way all of the companies offering through their distribution mechanisms. Now it is 2013. It’s time to see where IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, ITaaS, and other XaaS are heading. It’s time to see what ideas companies are kicking around and on what solutions they are doubling down in the coming years. Trends Most of the IT trends presented in prior SxSW Interactive years center on time to market, speed, and overall agility for companies. This year at SxSW a sampling of the Enterprise and IT specific topics range from apps ecosystems to gamification to identity to rapid deployment scenarios. In each topic the central themes often has a mix of opinions. On one hand, an implicit assumption is that only the future matters since legacy IT and legacy thinking is incapable of delivering next generation applications in a self service model. On the other hand, the slightly more pragmatic assumption is that all of the IT teams will demand greater speed and standardization to make that possible whether it is legacy or next generation. The discussions at SxSW almost always center on the app developer point of view and the user point of view. When the role of operations and management comes up the assumption is that the IT team has to get on board now or at the very least satisfy these demands even if it means going outside their IT walls to do it. End user computing and end user demand, it seems, waits for no one. As one colorful app developer put it in an equally colorful way: Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way! (heavily abridged)The velocity of VCE and our drive to unleash simplicity is in response to the convergence taking place at an ever quickening pace. These trends can best be summarized in the following YouTube videos. The CIO and CTO of the future demand simplicity. Executives want solutions. The future of IT requires a break through. DevOps demands intelligence, awareness, and integration. ","categories": [],

Yes, it has been a while so this post is going to be a summary of summaries. A Plan Comes Together The past few days have been exciting for me in a variety of ways.

My hope was to be looking 5 years out into the future. Pull Requests Culture If you have ever attempted to collaborate using documents, files, or other save and send approaches than you know how frustrating the world of Enterprise workplaces can be at times. Obviously, there is the notion of a corporate culture that might drive behaviours that lend to one person doing work while others chip in as permitted. What I mean is the tossing of a document back and forth without any semblance of revision tracking or use of available technology to promote a team effort and collective output. But does it really have to be that way? Perhaps you have seen the magic of simultaneous editing within Google Apps on a document or spreadsheet. Perhaps you recall the first time you saw Etherpad or the infamous Google Wave. That’s just a document though. What about applications that are not unlike your first ICQ chat or seeing the other person doing something on the other end of iMessage on their iPhone or multiplatform chat app. It’s telegraphing the possibility of contribution. You are miles apart but working closely together in the moment. But where do these modern applications live on the corporate desktop, laptop, and mobile endpoint? Oh. That’s right. All the smart kids are working on pokes, virtual farming, and BitCoin for Path Stickers mashups with $1B valuations. Wait. That’s not entirely true. In fact, I’d wager that there will be a huge number of consumer web kids that begin to find the world of revenue before the first billion users to be something worth their time and attention.

        "title": "A Timely Question",
        "excerpt":"Sometimes the inspiration from a post comes from a question. This is a question I recently received from someone that is in the IT industry. Specifically, the question revolved around where IT is heading and what are the skills and training that are advisable to anticipate where IT is heading. Schrödinger’s Floppy Drive If I was looking out 3-5 years the areas I would focus in on are an understanding of the characteristics of matured and highly evolved environments. Areas and topics like automation, orchestration, and security posture principles are key. A paradigm shift is underway for the coming wave of outsourced IT as a Service, continuous integration, and continuous deployment. Catch that wave. Things are changing fast in IT. Assumptions about IT are changing faster. Chewing Gum Stackages It’s going to be an increasingly portmanteau world. Basically, there will always be a place for datacenter environments that house compute, storage, and networking elements. For the past three years and going forward they will increasingly converge into simplified ordered stacks (example: Vblock Systems) that allow for applications to be stood up and used by non IT staff. The Future is Eventually Consistent However, over the next 3-5 years there will be marked shifts in the ability to consume resources normally associated with private datacenters to ones that are service provider maintained or located among several service providers. The current and future generations of developers already use Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace, Microsoft Azure, VMware vCloud Hybrid Service, and an almost algal bloom of niche service provider offerings. They got it a while ago and get it now. These are the next creators of what is next in mobile and the Internet of Everything and they already live a partially realized reality to this assured eventuality. IT will be compelled to deliver on built-in analytics for the growing data that is increasingly used to make business decisions. IT will be the sieve and perhaps just perhaps the I in IT will stand for intelligence vs. information in just a few years. Continuous Deployment of Knowledge The new toolsets used by increasingly mobile developers and application creators will democratize and further isolate and abstract those groups from the very infrastructure they consumer, tear down, and recreate multiple times per week, day, hour, or even by the minute. This is the notion of continuous deployment. This is the notion of the so-called DevOps movement. IT is and will continue to blur and shift from the way we think of it today. That knowledge – that very intelligence technology will indeed be the new IT. If I was starting over from scratch again I would start with a regiment of courses (most freely available btw) on agile methods, devops, and explore any interviews or internships within teams and companies compelled by new mandates to be increasingly in those settings.

        "excerpt":"Next month I’ll reach my 3 year mark with VCE.  (In fact there is a tag just for VCE… Three years of VCE to be exact!) The VCE rocketship has only continued to accelerate since I jumped on board. I’m consistently amazed at what VCE has been able to accomplish in this short amount of time. There is still much work to do but I am happy and fortunate to be part of the team. The vision from 2010 is the reality of 2013. Ubiquitous workload substrate and an everything just works data center world are not so much a destination but an ever advancing goal. Here’s to the vision of 2014 and beyond. Combinatorial optimization FTW!!! To that end, VCE is launching the next generation of market leading true converged infrastructure solutions on September 17, 2013.

In short – buy a Vblock. Here is a sample of what I mean in their own words:   What I appreciated most about Vblocks was that I didn’t waste any time discussing storage, compute or network hardware. – SearchSDN   What makes this fascinating to me is I don’t know any other vendor that does this as aggressively. – Datamation   That VCE is making so strong an impact in so short a time is a testimony to the uncommon quality of both its Vblock solutions and its market approach. – ITTNA   With this new VCE partnership, we can now drop ship our private platform to customers and partners worldwide much faster so they can leverage its power and scalability to secure their IT infrastructures or those of their customers. – Qualys   Vblock has freed up time so they can put more effort and resources into custom applications and the things that are driving their business versus just keeping the lights on with infrastructure. – CRN   Our strong partnership with VCE helps to ensure that enterprises can achieve these efficiencies that come from cross-platform integration and automation in their cloud infrastructure. – BMC   Not only are EMC backup and recovery solutions pre-configured, pre-integrated, and pre-tested to work across all hardware and software components in the Vblock System, they also are built right into the VCE cabinetry with 10 Gig-E cable direct connects, so that setting up a secondary backup network is no longer necessary. – Cisco   It was a tall order, but by standardizing on the Vblock architecture and virtualizing applications our dedicated team of engineers and technicians were able to complete the initial Cloud Data Center build on schedule. – EMC   Native integration of VCE innovative converged infrastructure systems with VMware’s industry-leading management solutions will help our joint enterprise and service provider customers further simplify, automate and modernize management of their software-defined datacenter environments – VMware   A Vblock from VCE isn’t just a sum of its parts—it’s a new way of implementing and supporting mission-critical infrastructure.

        "title": "Be My Advisor",
        "excerpt":"Recently, I was invited to become an advisor to Racemi. I said yes. Background Over the years a lot of startup companies haved reached out to me and asked if I would consider being an advisor. It’s flattering. It’s exciting. It’s tempting. It’s also a huge commitment to make. This kind of ask is not uncommon considering my background and the exposure it affords me. Of course, I say no more than I have said yes but I take the time to explain why I say no so much more than I say yes. Previously, I’ve been an advisor to many more startup companies. Most of them no longer exist. Reflections upon correlation and causation are out of scope for this post. Recently, I’ve had more than a few folks ask what my thought processes are on being an advisor.   Disclaimer: IANAL and nothing from this point forward constitutes anything other than words in a markdown text file being rendered for your viewing amusement When I Say Yes Presently, I’m an advisor to several startup companies – some named like AwayFind and most recently Racemi – and some stealth. In most cases I have purposely limited myself at 0.1% to .75% in my grant size over a 24 to 36 month period of monthly vesting without a cliff. The goal is to be useful and timely while preserving the equity for the team that is doing the actual day to day heavy lifting. How I Say Yes Startups come in many types and stages. Some startups are scrappy pre-funding bootstrap variety startups, some have taken angel funding and others have taken seed and others have taken additional series and been acquired which is another reason for the variance in grant size based on pre-money vs. dilution. Often, I’ll require an expense clause consistent with my own consulting rate card regardless to keep an awareness of the externality of the relationship. I’ll even attach my last versioned consulting rate card to make sure there is no ambiguity as to the value of my time. You might be saying… wow, those last few paragraphs sound really well thought out and fair… and there’s a reason for that. People much better at this than me have been at this for much longer than I have so please review this post from Matt Bartus to understand the method that I subscribe to and recommend for advisor grants. Next, temper that post with the Founder Advisor Standard Template embedded at this TechCrunch article that still holds up well. When I Say No Just for a moment, let’s just say that my advice is hypothetically worth $100 to $250 an hour. I give a range so that this thought excercise won’t wrap folks around the axle of how cheap or how expensive that sounds. (Hint: ask a lawyer or similar services firm what they make per hour off of startups and keep in mind IANAL) Now let’s look at a scenario where a startup is only asking for an advisor and isn’t sure how to compare advisor value. Consider that at 0.2% grant size my value of $250 per hour is reasonable for the depth and experience I bring as an advisor. Now consider a weekly commitment of between 1 and 3 hours is a reasonable amount that should not to exceed 8 hours in any given month. So, in terms of my value you’d have “spent” ~$40k over 24 months for my time and energies.  Alternatively, moving me to 1% grant size would represent up to 24-30 hours in any given month where you “spent” ~$200k over 24 months for my time and energies.  My risk increases (I’m just a consultant just providing advice after all) as grant size increases as the expected hours would be normally generating revenue for my own business so I’m sure you can appreciate my position. Now consider this before I tell you “No” – what could you have done with ~$200k over 24 months if we had not met and talked? Now consider this before I tell you “No” – what person on your team would you really allow to only work 8-10 hours a week? Now consider this before I tell you “No” – why haven’t you asked me for a ~$200k angel investment? How I Say No It’s flattering. It’s exciting. It’s tempting. It’s also a huge commitment to make. I have to say “No”. I wish you all the luck in the world! Update for 2015 Just in the spirit of prior art, check out these posts from Peter Chee, Fred Wilson, and Joel Gascoigne. Update for 2016 Often While clicking around in suggested reading channels on vibrant Slack teams (as one does these days) I come across interesting links and recall this blog post. Again, in the spirit of prior art, please check out The Open Guide to Equity Compensation. Update for 2017 Thanks again to the entire Racemi team for the past three years. It has been a pleasure!

        "excerpt":" &lt;/a&gt; End of month, end of quarter, end of year… what an amazing time of the season. It’s time for a quick reflection before I go back heads down again… At some point this year I crossed over into the territory of relocating yet again. Looking back on the work travel patterns for 2013 it is clear that it was different than 2012, 2011, and 2010. The trend is one of acceleration year over year and having a solid business oriented airport is key for me now. I’ve found that. I’m in Las Vegas now. Hi. :smile: Why Las Vegas? When I was researching the best airports for work travel it didn’t take long to see LAS as a great option. Reviewing travel costs for 2013 reflects that as well. While I still favor Delta there are a ton of options to choose from here. I’m increasingly fond of Virgin America – it is such a different experience compared to say, United. Then again, the new wifi service from Southwest Airlines has my curiosity piqued. We shall see… :wink: All Work and No Play? My weekends and down time has allowed me to catch acts like Joe Satriani, Steve Morse, and Black Sabbath with Ozzy and Tony Iommi. I look forward to catching many many more. It’s funny because I’m not really a drinker these days and I’m not much for gambling and reliving a Hangover-esque evening isn’t high on my agenda but there is something about this place that gets me. Having a pass to Red Rock Canyon is just awesome. I’ve got a favorite coffee place, a favorite bagel place, tons of Foursquare recommendations to work through and I have been spending time at InNEVation soaking up the vibe as well. Good stuff. What’s Up With the Vegas Tech Scene?     Recently, I had a chance to sit down and discuss the merits of the startup ecosystem in Las Vegas and what I think is a good way to jump in and get a feel for the scene. Having spent time in San Francisco before and finding the niche there I came up with a list (in no specific order) of what resources I feel are good ones to consider when approaching the Vegas tech scene.   Twitter: Follow this hashtag on Twitter: #vegastech and look for venues and startup references  AngelList: Join AngelList and set your location to Las Vegas  Local Startups: Check out these companies on AngelList Las Vegas and follow them  Tech Cocktail: Join and attend Tech Cocktail and ask Frank Gruber for suggestions  InNEVation: Subscribe to the InNEVation calendar and consider a monthly membership to the most amazing facility that you could possibly imagine  RoR Meeting: Join and attend the Ruby on Rails Meetup and the hackathons  Vegas Tech Fund: Check out the Vegas Tech Fund companies and connect with their teams  Downtown Speaker Series: Buy a ticket to the next Downtown Speaker Series and keep an eye out for new ones  Work in Progress: Buy a day pass for each coworking location and figure out what vibe is you at Work In Progress  Startup Events Calendar: Attend ‘Tea and Teams’ style events  Meetups: Check out the Co-working Meetup to connect with other nomadic knowledge workers  Facebook: Add yourself to the Vegas Tech Group on FacebookGranted, this isn’t an exhaustive listing but it’s one I am striving to immerse myself in when I’m not traveling for work.

        "excerpt":"Wordplay comes out in the oddest places. I was thinking about amusing apparel worn by several VCE folks and VCE alumni at conferences like OpenStack Summit, RICON, and Gluecon. Specifically, the “Vblock Systems: Loving Pets and Cattle Equally since 2009” came to mind.  . @jdooley_clt @stevie_chambers @aka_dugan so awesome &#10;/cc @VMTrooper @jmckenty pic.twitter.com/QJJxc2SFkh &mdash; Jay Cuthrell (@Qthrul) January 13, 2014Of course, this “pets and cattle” micro meme was in reference to fairly recent clouderati neologism that seeks to distance the world of older IT workloads such as Microsoft Exchange from the new school of fancy new IT workloads like Node.js or flat out platform as a service or what a Google / Facebook / so-called web scale infrastructure would have on the menu. While funny teeshirt slogans are a hit, I always felt there was a bit more nuance and not a hard bifurcation point in classifications of workloads. Indeed, one of the prevalent themes in most of the customer meetings is what is the best way to rationalize ever growing populations of workloads – and there is rarely a mere two camps or categorizations. Rather, there seems to be a very host oriented discussion in places where the exposure to Enterprise IT has been lesser than a greenfield view of the IT world. For example, even a simple home grown application might need various web servers, application services, and underlying datastores in addition to the plumbing and surrounding accouterments to make that workload a viable and sustainable part of an IT catalog of offerings or as part of an IT portfolio. I call the vast oversimplification of this diversity the “Cloud Computing Canard” because of the duality of being duck like and a foul (fowl?) rumor. This is one with adequate jest and a respectful tip of the hat to Simon Wardley. The 5 P’s of Workloads Cloud Computing Canard: &#10;Parrots - MC Legacy IT&#10;Parakeets - Generational IT&#10;Poultry - Canard of Cattle&#10;Popeyes - SP IaaS&#10;Pigeons - Nuisances &mdash; Jay Cuthrell (@Qthrul) October 21, 2013To better illustrate my point in meetings and when presenting to wider audiences, I am leery of rolling out the ‘pets vs. cattle’ neologism and have opted instead for a decidedly tiered approach to classify a simple collection of rationalized applications within a given IT portfolio. The simple way to say it is the 5 P’s of Workloads: Parrots, Parakeets, Poultry, Popeyes, and Pigeons. Parrots  Parrots are the legacy IT workloads that a C-level IT person would likely find on their first day at the office… and it would likely still be there on their last day in the office with an amazing amount of investment in capital and time to make that workload, forgive the pun, talk nicely. So, like actual parrots that very often outlive their owners in the real world, a parrot can live far longer than your career lifetime. Examples could include legacy business logic systems written or packaged to run on a specific dependency riddled OS and library collection that mandates a maniacal dedicated legacy silo of something akin to the bare metal only requirements seen in certain vertical industry specific ISV landscapes. Some would even say that a mainframe application is the canonical example of a parrot style workload. Because, as we will all agree… a legacy mainframe application is sometimes quite far from being a post parrot. Parakeets  Parakeets are the legacy IT workloads that a C-level IT person will likely cycle through with each new addition to their tactical or strategic teams that decides a new way of doing what the older IT workload did should do but a brand new everything is involved to make that happen. So, like the parakeet that parents give their children that has a life well lived but ultimately it passes away and a new parakeet is brought in to replace it over some period of time with new toys, cages, feeding gadgets, and more. Examples could include going from Microsoft Exchange 2007 to Exchange 2010 and brand new infrastructure to support that workload in ways that the older environment might not have had. Poultry  Poultry is the ownership oriented view of a C-level IT person that wants a near vertical level of integration in how IT workloads are deployed in a uniform and consistent manner. Like poultry farming there are lots of identical birds everywhere and a high degree of common supporting systems in place to care and feed those birds with regular cycling of the birds as demands rise and fall. Examples could include a specific Linux or Windows deployment where workloads can be virtualized or packaged for rapid deployment here or there of whatever makes the most economically sound path. These need not be public chicken coops per se… indeed, many viable chicken coops are private in nature. Still, most would agree that the largest of the large chicken farms are massively efficient and favor a flavor that tastes like chicken. It is truly the season of seasoning, no? Popeyes  Popeyes is the fully executed vision of any C-level IT person that realizes IT workloads that combines generalized and specific IT infrastructure all of which is managed, automated, and orchestrated with self-service capabilities aligned to specific lines of business. Granted, unless you travel a lot in the United States or spend time in the Southeastern United States, the Popeyes reference might be lost on you. Suffice to say, Popeyes is an example of Poultry as a Service if you will. It’s in the business of supplying a fast and tasty experience involving plucked prepared poultry pleasantly peppered and packaged for popping in your mouth. Mmmm mmmm good. More importantly, you drive up to a window and get it. That’s right. Poultry as a Service (PaaS). The tastier PaaS if you will. So, in this instance, Popeyes is the drive thru experience as applied to IT workloads. Hungry for some IT? Place your order and drive away. Hungry for more? Repeat this process. Pigeons  Pigeons are the failed executions of a C-level IT person that hoped to take workloads and create a new way to deliver but ended up with an overly complex and cumbersome sprawling implementation that becomes a far greater nuisance that only delights those that feed the systems involved and encourage their growth to a point where nobody remembers why the workload mattered in the first place or who owns it. So, like the pigeons that can often be a pest or nuisance within dense population centers it is the pigeon that leaves ‘feathers and poop’ where it lives. Worse still, they tend to multiply. Plethoras of Peeping, Pecking, Poults Yeah, I said 5 P’s and this is clearly number 6 to any possible number if you continue to fuse a letter p approach to this poetic exercise. The point (sorry) being is that there is wondrous variation to take into account. For example, a marketing or vocal line of business led infrastructure selection could be a peacock. So, sometimes saying that it is pets vs. cattle isn’t enough. Omg. That was hilarious @Qthrul pic.twitter.com/MHC5pESSMp &mdash; kenny coleman (@KendrickColeman) April 25, 2014The good news… all of these fowl that are not so foul have a place to roost and can be loved equally.

This can result in a memorable word that can shorthand a concept when used in confined and previously informed parties. For example, adding an A before Mathematics to be Applied Mathematics becomes STEAM. Alternatively, one could add that same A and introduce the notion of Arts in addition to the other pursuit areas of STEM. In the spirit of addressing the human values aspects of STEM I’d like to propose the following backronym expansion of STEM to include Empathy and Ethics: ESTEEM Ethics, Science, Technology, Engineering, Empathy, and Mathematics ESTEEM would start with an examination of Ethics across the range of fields and pursuits. Further, ESTEEM would include an examination of Empathy inclusive of the outcomes possible from STEM pursuits. One could argue that Empathy would be a portion of the examination of Ethics. People even write books about these things. So while there is a case to be made for making Ethics and Empathy some kind of interchangeable or fungible concept it isn’t my goal to promote that notion. Instead, I’m going to ignore that and not attempt to unify or classify in this way and keep Ethics and Empathy in two distinct areas. Here’s why. I think STEM itself is similar enough sounding like stem to confuse folks that think it is a part of a plant (which is also admittedly kind of cool). I’d really like to have people confuse ESTEEM with the very thing that humans need to have for all forms of life and the variety of life itself both known and yet to be known – healthy and sustainable respect internally and externally and communally. The Origins of Meme I was incredibly fortunate to be able to attend (and eventually finish) college. While I may not have become a Materials Science Engineer it was the exposure to the non STEM electives that formed my view of the world of what is called STEM. First, I took a history course called “History of Science and Technology”. In that course I learned that science is that which explains and predicts whereas technology is the response to a perceived need. Second, I took a multi-disciplinary studies course called “Science, Technology, and Human Values” . In that course I learned that, among other things, just because you can doesn’t mean you should. In a nutshell, science is important and grasping technology is important and being grounded in engineering is important and none of it happens without mathematics but all of it still requires that the student understand what has preceded them and the ethical quandaries leading to this point in time and the development of empathy in the future. Update for 2017 I was listning to the local NPR station today and learned Anil Dash was interviewed by Krista Tippett of “OnBeing”. As soon as I heard the first fewminutes of the interview I knew I needed to revisit this post from 2014. Three years have gone by since I wrote this and it would appear that many of themost visible personalities in the tech world are beginning to get asked deeperquestions. I see this as progress. IMHO, the sobering tone of the interview should not be confused with despair… but one ofcautious hope… Enjoy. ","categories": [],

        "title": "My Fourth Year at VCE",
        "excerpt":"Today is my four year mark with VCE. 4 years. Wow.  Oh. One more thing… This is also my first net new blog post using GitHub Pages. I’ve decided that I will be pushing updates in this way. So far, GitHub Pages is slightly easier than keeping up with Octopress on a virtual server which was easier than keeping up with WordPress on a virtual server which was easier than keeping up with a dedicated physical server in my own private managed colo. I’ve evolved as have the tools. This can all change. That’s kind of the point. Given enough time I’ll eventually be migrating over my content from fudge.org (bit by bit). My thinking is that GitHub Pages provides an entirely hosted approach to my content and rendering of that content via redcarpet markdown. While I’ll still have a local repo, I’m not planning on chewing local CPU to render with Octopress / Jeckyll only to push updates to what is ostensibly a flat file server on the Interwebs. Simpler. Easier. I can even pen from a browser again. My next version of this blog will probably involve something relating to Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Web Services in terms of the technology stack. We shall see. It’s not like a blog is a heavy app but I think there are some interesting things I could do if I ever depart from flat file rendering. Maybe. But what about VCE? Oh yes, VCE. Let’s talk about VCE. Well, that’s the thing isn’t it. One doesn’t simply talk about VCE and our very secretive ways. [REDACTED] ROADMAP [REDACTED] &#10;[REDACTED] ROADMAP [REDACTED] &#10;[REDACTED] ROADMAP [REDACTED] &mdash; ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ (@Qthrul) September 10, 2014These are my opinions. I’ll say that a lot in this post or at least twice. When I see something factual to link to I’ll do so but what follows are my opinions. Did I mention that these are my opinions? Seriously. What about VCE? It’s telling that VCE has been compared to Apple by some. That secrecy has served VCE well… in my opinion. &quot;@VCE also said it is on a $1.8 Billion annualized demand run rate coming out of 2013.&quot;&#10;-- @Jim_Duffy @NetworkWorld&#10;http://t.co/rKnJpjXBwg &mdash; Jay Cuthrell (@JayCuthrell) May 9, 2014So in the year since my last update I can say that VCE has publicly disclosed that we did in excess of 1 Bilion dollars in revenue and achieved in excess of 1.8 Billion dollars in run rate. Even just typing in those numbers is slightly unnerving. GULP! You see, VCE has been predicted to fail, implode, be torn apart, be ravaged by silicon based squid-like alien forces, and essentially was born to die. Well, most of that gloom and doom comes from a select few voices that have their own agendas. In summary: Haters gonna hate Truly thankful for the tech pundits and FUD slingers that said @VCE was &#39;doomed&#39; in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, ???&#10;http://t.co/S3eIzg3DhH &mdash; ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ (@Qthrul) December 24, 2013Fun fact: I actually maintain a summary listing of all of the gloom and doom predictions that goes all the way back to 2009. It’s 2014 and looking back to see just how fundamentally flawed and flat out wrong tech journalism has become (in certain segments) is telling. It’s like a scrapbook of fail… in my opinion. &quot; @VCE [...] has dispelled many of the earlier market doubts &quot; -- @Gartner_inc http://t.co/gT6t5ZQNXG &mdash; Jay Cuthrell (@JayCuthrell) June 18, 2014What’s up? Since my yearly updates take place far before our investors produce their own reports and numbers to show the market what is truly up… I’ll just have to say that I’ve been very busy… in my opinion. &quot;We view @VCE as a natural extension of our [...] strategy” -- John Chambers, chairman and CEO, @Cisco &#10;&#10;http://t.co/5tf56AicLb &mdash; Jay Cuthrell (@JayCuthrell) May 8, 2014Per @VMware CEO at #VMworld : &#10;&quot; @VCE has knocked it out of the park &quot;&#10;http://t.co/pnzyhRYwDJ &mdash; Jay Cuthrell (@JayCuthrell) August 28, 2014Moving to Las Vegas was exactly what I needed to do for the type of trips I’ve been taking over the past 12 months. So many meetings with prospects that are now VCE customers. So many trips to meet with our partners to build the alliances that will help propel VCE in ways I could only previously imagine. Considering the massive global expansions in 2012 that took me to a dozen different contries I’ve was fortunate to primarily stay domestic for 2013. Yet, I’ve put in the same or more miles domestically. For 2014 even though I’ve left the country a few times it has been within this hemisphere. Of course, I have no idea what 2015 will hold… but I will be busy… in my opinion. Busy doing what? It varies from day to day. Sometimes I am considering research and development topics. Sometimes I am looking at the wider competitive landscape and how it evolves. Sometimes I am meeting and exploring wider relationships formalized through alliances and partnerships. And other times… I am meeting with a lot of customers and even more prospects that become our customers. The big trade shows for me have been EMC World, Cisco Live, and VMworld. In the middle of those I’ve been able to attend a few more events but those were typically related to alliance activities and I can’t even talk much about those here. I’ll just say they were awesome… in my opinion. There are +200 openings at @VCE globally.&#10;Curious? Go here: http://t.co/JffDFaEX6G pic.twitter.com/ZpKsaiN0kK &mdash; Jay Cuthrell (@JayCuthrell) May 24, 2014When I am asked what kind of exposure I’ve had since 2010 to customers, it is easy to say that I’ve had, literally, hundreds of conversations. Just do the math. It’s just impressive to reflect on that. Looking back at my posts about VCE since 2010 are telling. Even then I knew that every 6 months there would be something amazing happening. The challenge was of course to keep it on the down low and stay under the radar for as long as possible. Tick. Tock. In the time since my first posts I’ve learned a lot about what it takes to go from zero to a billion dollars in revenue. I know what that machine looks like and I know the passion, people, processes, and purpose it takes to crush all the records. Thousands of Vblock Systems are all around the world now. I still remember the day we crossed over there being more Vblock Systems commissioned than we had employees globally. That kind of growth isn’t something many people ever get to experience in their careers. I did and for that I’m incredibly thankful. What’s next? Sometimes I tell stories about what I think is next. Sometimes I am lucky enough to do that while a camera is recording it. Let’s see how well my answers hold up over time. Ideally, I’d like to think I can continue these yearly updates and look back on them and reflect. The funny thing is that I haven’t really done that with the prior posts. In fact, my only other posts this year were on topics that have no direct correlation to VCE. My VCE blogging shifted to more internal stories that are behind the firewall within VCE and across our investor portals. My posts were for a rapidly growing organization. My posts were to capture much of the tribal knowledge in a formal way and explain my point of view and my view of the future. The future is near. &quot; Stay tuned... We are just getting started. &quot; -- @TreyLayton VP and Global CTO @VCE at @CiscoLive #CLUS pic.twitter.com/96aWpjKgHq &mdash; Jay Cuthrell (@JayCuthrell) May 19, 2014When I started at VCE there were some accomplishments I had in mind. Ubiquitous workload substrates were how I framed it back then. The goal was big, hairy, and audacious or whatever you call those crazy bars you set to get motivated to do something big. When I think about the biggest take away from all of this work so far I think it is still just a beginning. Sometimes it isn’t that you are going to make a dent in the universe but you have to get a running start before you run into something. If I was to put the past 12 months into perspective the theme would be about finding balance in the work / life mix. The mythical sirens are calling you back to the repositories and the demands are nonstop. That said, we aren’t a company of a few dozen people these days. We are a global workforce with a purpose and a mission to transform the data center. You get to see people step up now. You get to see people rewarded. You get to see people move on in their lives and careers. It isn’t the same crazy as when we started but it is still pretty crazy but just in a larger more global way.

Worse, if we are are not all diligent then we find that we will be told what is interesting.

Blogs Away It’s been a few months since my last post on this blog. Considering my random to periodic pace since joining VCE in 2010, I haven’t blogged much about VCE lately either. In fact, my last update on the topic of VCE was late last year. That’s okay. It is. VCE has a blog now and there have been lots of posts on a variety of topics. Cisco Live Redux Personally, I’m just getting back from meetings with customers at Cisco Live where VCE, again, had a huge presence this year.

Blogging is ultimately an ability to have a personal publishing platform. Blogging need not be an exhaustive attempt to somehow upload the entirety of a conscisouness. Blogging can simply be a flat text file containing markdown that is organized to convey a concept, idea, direction, opinion set or merely to mark a moment. This post is the latter.

Third, I’ve completed hundreds if not around a thousand customer meetings! Being close to customers is incredibly rewarding and I am grateful and thankful for that constant exposure.

        "excerpt":"I’d like to expend a few words about The Perfect Team. My career in technology has taught me many things. Even now in my 5th year at VCE the lessons continue. Truly, refinement is achieved through continuous iterations to unlock innovations. So, perhaps the most important thing I’ve learned over the years is the concept of The Perfect Team. The Perfect Team is disarmingly simple to define. The Perfect Team is one person to do it, one person to write it down, and one person to think ahead. So, if the definition of The Perfect Team sounds a bit like a minimum viable concept applied to innovation centers or ad hoc teaming – it is, in fact, just that by design. The Perfect Team definition can be tested if you simply attempt to think through removal of any of the three key roles. Each role as a sole or sequestered activity is a far lesser contributor alone and yet together they comprise The Perfect Team. For example, some might argue that the person to do it is all that is truly required. However, this do it only approach limits visibility and awareness of the person to write it down and forgoes cycles of thought to consider what should be done next by the person to think ahead. Such an isolation to only emphasize the person to do it is a common folly of so-called heroic culture companies that are often regarded as inconsistent in execution capability. Think back on the teams you’ve been on and ask yourself if you had The Perfect Team. If you did not have The Perfect Team, what role was missing or not provided sufficient independence to work along side the other roles? Or, perhaps you did not have two roles? ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"2015 was a whirlwind just as the past five years have been since I joined VCE. That’s a good thing. Expect and Embrace Change I was told early on to expect and embrace change. The announcements made by VCE for 2016 are a great example of that change I was told about back in 2010. So years later as I reflect on the change and think about my role evolving along with the company it occured to me that I am both expecting and embracing change.  Yesterday, I had the chance to present to a wider group within Federation. One of the requests from the facilitator was to include a slide that would introduce you, the speaker. This was up to the speaker of course as some folks will have head shots and others might have the original photo from their first badge with the company. Not everyone has an updated photo. I don’t either but I had my levity inducing slide from before and used it. The reason for the request is because, like many presentations, the audience is attending via WebEx. Sometimes putting a face with a voice over a network based presentation can help make for a more human presenation. My new &quot;About Me&quot; intro slide pic.twitter.com/WIaLbbkVea &mdash; Jay Cuthrell (@JayCuthrell) August 14, 2015Of course, I updated my template but this was the gist. Then something happened. My chat lit up. There were a bunch of folks that were ex-Nortel on the WebEx. Smalllllll world!!!! That got me thinking. This was my first presentation with my new title and new role. My new title is Director of Technology Strategy. I’m on a team within the Global Office of the CTO at VCE, the Converged Platforms Division of EMC. Or, for short, EMC Converged Platforms. Anyway, marketing and branding aside, putting up a photo that wasn’t just a headshot but a picture of the past and today (well, technically a sort of recently updated photo) was more than levity inducing. It connected me to an audience. We had something in common other than being at the same company today and discussing [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as it relates to the next phase in VCE 3.0 technology strategy. The Path Ahead The take away for me is that you can change the names, you can alter the branding, and you can even change directions. What is important is that you expect and embrace change. What was true in 2010 is true for 2016 and beyond. I stopped making New Year’s Resoltions years ago. I think you can expect and embrace change when you decide to make change real and personal for you. An arbitrary date on a calendar isn’t a requirement. So, while others enjoy them and I enjoy hearing and seeing others mark their yearly change – I’m equally happy to pick any day in a year. So, here is to 2016. Here is to change in every way that I can expect and embrace. Here is to change that I purposfully seek out and realize in my new role. Here is to finding moments to reflect upon change. One area of change will be in the publishing of content. I’m going to partner up and get a podcast going in 2016. It will probably involve blog posts too. For now, the bumper is simple and gives me a chance to use some of my own music. Initially, topics will be related to the company or at the very least the technology ecosystem that is undergoing… change. The website and postcast is simply called Unicorn Jockeys. It’s empty now but it will fill out as the year progresses. Listeners can expect conversations about convergence, cloud, IT, data centers, transformation, and all things in between. For 2016, I’m going to be looking at ways to discuss [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as it relates to the next phase in VCE 3.0 technology strategy on this blog or at a suitable company blog outlet. I’ve created far more content behind the firewall from 2010-2015 and I’m looking forward to 2016 as a departure from purely internal publishing. We shall see. And now… Please see my disclosure. I’ll do my best to make sure the content of my blog posts that mention work at the very least have slightly more words than the boilerplate I’m pasting below from the bottom of Chad’s post. And now… the obligatory appending of text! Forward-Looking Statement Legend This release contains “forward-looking statements” as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) risks associated with the proposed acquisition of EMC by Denali Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Dell, Inc., including, among others, assumptions related to the ability to close the acquisition, the expected closing date and its anticipated costs and benefits; (ii) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (iii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iv) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (v) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (vi) component and product quality and availability; (vii) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.’s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (viii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (ix) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (x) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (xi) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xii) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xiii) threats and other disruptions to our secure data centers or networks; (xiv) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (xv) war or acts of terrorism; and (xvi) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

I went from zero to just over 1700 connections in a few weeks so if you were ever curious about the impact of a digital cleanse on LinkedIn, don’t worry. Most of it comes back quickly:    For example, my newly recreated graph looks like this for Top 5’s by Company: (248) Dell EMC(204) VCE( 86) Cisco( 61) VMware( 44) DellTop 5’s by Location: (237) San Francisco Bay Area(161) Greater Boston Area(134) Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina Area(111) Dallas/Fort Worth Area( 44) Austin, Texas AreaSo, in general, LinkedIn is one way to view things but not the only way to view things. Vetting and data scrubbing on LinkedIn is still somewhere between apathy and rot. I do miss my endorement for goat herding and unicorn jockey skills. Serious business! 😂 On the other hand, if you are looking for another kind of vetting you can find me on Keybase.io (I have invites left): https://keybase.io/jaycuthrell My travel duties might pick up a bit over the next few months but I’m enjoying Austin (miss you Las Vegas) and the pursuit of the perfect taco is eternal.

You might remember the first time someone exposed you to the concept of gettingthings done and all the power this simple phrase promised to deliver. Youprobably also remember when slap bracelets were a thing. Indeed, even the proponents of so-called agile methodologies will impress upondevotees (or anyone that will listen) that a standing meeting is a way tophysically exhaust attendees that might otherwise spend longer times in meetingswere they seated. Perhaps the next progession is to run meetings while doing agility drills or maybe even calisthenics. How much ya bench backlog? The Promise of Artificial Intelligence First… a video montage moment depicting a future AI to AI abstraction… Years from now, we will all look back – but not at the marvel of AI but at themarvel that was marketing adoption of the term AI as the word to search andreplace for in copy that previously referred to real time, social graph, orthe latest darling on demand. So, does the hype match the execution? Five years ago, Microsoft bought Skype. Now, I might know folks at both placesbut this commentary is just me riffing. I’ll just say that I had high hopes andstill do. A Skypenotification from someone named &quot;Clippy&quot; asking if they can help mestart a conference call? Sure.

I just know that if AI is a part of the story, I’m skeptical. Alternatives To Waiting I’ve hired virtual assistants before. The results were mixed. I’ve tried various email this or click this web applications to generate quorum.Again, the results were mixed. I’ve tried the free versions of AI-ish or been involved with startups in pursuitof serendipitous calendar integration. For most, results were mixed until theresults were no longer viable business models. Of special note, I do think that the folks behind x.ai are clever. The space is getting more crowded or shrinking depending on your perspective. Here’s a useful query to keep track of recent listicles https://www.google.com/search?tbs=qdr%3Ay&amp;q=calendly+x.ai+tools So, for now at least, I’m using a few alternatives while I await meetingscheduling nirvana   World Clock Meeting Planner  SunCalc  World Time Buddy  Time Zones  When2meet  etc…Future Feature Parity I’ve had access (and still have access) to executive assistants. Without adoubt, people are just plain awesome if your business model permits. Further,some might argue that people with executive assistant skills are exactly whatpermits many modern business models to persist in the first place. It’s easy to see why startups want to embody what an executive assistant can doas machine learning models and selective task defintions. Once there is aminimum viable product the next step seems to be a freemium to premium trialware approach. Or, the startup exits or fails and is reconsumed into another startup. If only there was AI for pricing models. Actually, that probably existssomewhere too. 😉 ","categories": [],

Notifications Zero and Notifications BankruptcyInbox Zero - YouTubewww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareInbox Zero and email bankruptcy are “decade ago” nostalgia milestonesLong Live Notifications Zero#chatops #mobilehttps://t.co/4RHHkizRcIIf you know me then you know I tend to become infatuated with new tools for collaboration, sharing, and the like. Years ago these tools were referred to as groupware. Yes, I really liked Google Wave.When I came across this Google Tech Talk from 2007 about “Inbox Zero” it was part of my quest to look back a decade or more for patterns and dated references. Here, looking back at the notion of getting things done using an email inbox as a means of workflow is a mix of nostalgia and frustration.The nostalgia comes from remembering just how many emails you might have sent in your life or remembering an email that brings back a fond memory. You might even recall printing out an email and hanging it up as a memento of sorts. I know I did that.The frustration comes from knowing that email is where good ideas or valuable information seem to be buried under updates that are of little value (not to be confused with this digest update!). Perhaps you are into the newer reboot of older interfaces like IRC or threaded message forums seen in the latest groupware such as Slack. Then again, perhaps you know others that won’t benefit from Slack because, for them, email is good enough – and that might be frustrating too.Depending on when you began to use email, email inboxes became a digital equivalent for physical inboxes for postal mail. Spam was annoying until Gmail mostly stopped the worst of spam.If you use a mobile version or a web browser version of tools like Slack it will be apparent that the new inbox is… notifications. At this point, I’ve taken to turning off email notifications and rely upon the visual notifications. Usually it is the red circle with a number that is meant to convey SOMETHING TO CLICK ON RIGHT NOW.It’s no small wonder that there are already references to Notifications Zero and declaring Notifications Bankruptcy.Ah, innovation…￼ meet the new inbox… same as the old inbox!BTW, you can find me here on Slack clearing my notifications: {code} Communitycommunity.emccode.com&ndash;ShareSlack Team for {code} Communitycodecommunity.slack.com&ndash;Share{code} Community is powered by the fine folks at Dell EMC {code} Community","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;Thanks for sticking around! My second installment is a bit longer but I plan to settle on a word count soon enough.&quot;Set phasers to 11.&quot; -- Star Trek: Spinal Tap Edition The New Console and the Art of ITJay Cuthrell 🤓💡🚀☁ on Twitter: &quot;Great quote on new IT paradigms: &quot;This is not a world of wizards and clicky clicky anymore.&quot; -- @jtroyer https://t.co/DW06v30scE&quot;twitter.com&ndash;ShareJohn always has great sound bites.Part of the joy in listening to podcasts is that you can have moments where you are nodding your head and saying “yes” out loud. Of course, there are also moments where you might shake your head and say “what the…” but that’s less likely in podcasts you really enjoy.I really do enjoy The Cloudcast. Episode #278 with John Troyer provided a great quote that I wanted to attempt to unpack: “This is not a world of wizards and clicky clicky anymore”.My IT career background is maybe a bit odd in that I learned UNIX before I learned DOS. I didn’t get my first Windows machine until well after I had been running Linux (badly) and getting my feet wet with Digital UNIX, SGI Irix, HP-UX, IBM AIX, and… Mac OS was just a way to get a terminal session going on a UNIX host. Hah. I am proud of my command line interface (CLI) origins. I’m not ashamed.I’ve always enjoyed the command line. I’ve also, at times, bristled at wizards or other step by step means of getting something done on a computing platform. I guess I would rather read the man page.So it is a curious time to be in the IT industry as decades of wizard driven, step, step, step, done approaches to interacting with compute / network / storage / virtualization are reaching a pinnacle of sorts. Indeed, from PowerShell to a new appreciation of Linux there are more folks wanting to drop the GUI in favor of command line or – at the very least – mix and match.Perhaps you have met another IT professional that has only recently discovered command line, Linux, or a world where clicking Next in a GUI isn’t the only way to get things done. It is eye opening to see origins of bespoke component level configurations finding a new way with keystrokes.And yet, on the other side of the IT spectrum (if there is such a thing) are those that have started command line and ended up chasing the dragon in pursuit of all that scales. You’ve met those folks. You might even be those folks. Go distributed systems or go home.Like most pained metaphors, the world of GUI and CLI are not so much a horse race as much as they are about the convergence taking place in the user experiences foisted upon the humble IT person of tomorrow. Both the GUI and the CLI can and will coexist.That said, there will be shock to those that have only lived in one reality of GUI or CLI. It isn’t a question of if but when as Gibson’s future becomes more evenly distributed.For example, just pick on part of the IT stack… say, networking. Marketing and rhetoric around how networking will operate in a (more) modern way hit peaks in the past year or two. Yes. Software Defined Networking – sounds quaint now eh? Indeed, the same low level IP networking gear that required an industry standard incantation on a command line is already fast becoming the application of a convention as opposed to purely configuration. It is likely that the same mixing of realities can be said for the rest of a modern IT stack.Convergence will mean that sometimes a wizard of clicky goodness will work just fine and other times it will be a language binding that provides immensely more objectively generated command sets than primitive command lines before it did. One size and one approach rarely fits all use cases.Now, because it was drilled into my brain early in history of science and technology classes, I carry around definitions. Science is that which explains and predicts. Technology is the response to a perceived need. Art is a form of expression using a developed skill.So knowing both ways, GUI and CLI, will matter more now and even more in the future. More importantly, knowing when one way or the other makes the most sense will be how the science of IT swings back into the art of IT.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;For this update, I explore one item shared earlier on Twitter.Side note: One of the quirks of Revue is that the links for a tweet don’t appear as I was expecting them to. That’s disappointing but perhaps that’s why others using Revue connect so many other services other than Twitter. So, I’m missing some of the richer embedding features. Thanks for sticking around while I work out the bugs and features.4... 3... 2... 1Peter Schilling - Major Tom - YouTubewww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareSuggested soundtrack for this section…What an amazing time to be alive. We’re going to have mobile devices (and more) that contain multiple radios talking to multiple services. Oh right… that’s what exists today. Ignoring the humble iPhone, there are even some smart phones that let you listen to FM radio. Yes. Some.Think about what happens when convergence takes the next step towards ubiquitous connectivity just about anywhere on our planet. It’s amazing to consider the possibilities. It’s also amazing to think about what happens when it is nearly impossible find everyday items that won’t have a lot more communications capabilities built into them from the factory. What could possibly go wrong? Okay… Okay… Now, back to the positive optimistic view…Very low Earth orbit mini satellites, low motion and high motion drones, terrestrial millimeter wave radios, and a shifting tide in wireless spectrum auction winners will transform how we think of mobility. Also, our future won’t necessarily mean we will be buried in simply smarter handsets as generations prior were buried in smart phones, iPods, TVs, newspapers, books, or other manner of isolation.One such development that is finally getting coverage in other media outlets is Galileo aka European Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). That’s a big deal for objects big and small that may benefit from greater precision in location. At the same time, multiple low energy ecosystems like iBeacon, Eddystone, et al will attempt to find a way on the ever shrinking boards that make objects more addressable in the physical world. Now, if only there were a ubiquitous network to allow for communication.Now just add in some changing social mores regarding commercially available extensions and augmentation to our humanity and technological implants. Fun times ahead…On a slightly more humorous note, in the very near future this technology just might be what enables some people you probably know to finally find their gluteus maximus in the dark without the aid of both hands and a flashlight. 😂","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;Happy New Year! Are we done celebrating? Cool. Let’s get started…As a warning, this update is probably entering long form essay mode due to the nostalgia of what has happened along the rough timeline I’ve constructed. Otherwise – Enjoy!Side note: If you are enjoying these updates please share them with your peers on Twitter, Linkedin or whatever your preferred microblogging platform of choice might be. Thanks!20 Years In Streaming Music&quot;listening to old sk00l dave pearce&quot;twitter.com&ndash;Share10 years ago I signed up for a Twitter account (@qthrul) that would pump out 40,000 tweets in just over 7 years before I moved on to another more professionally namesaked Twitter account (@JayCuthrell).My first “tweet” in 2007 referenced back to just over a decade prior when I had come to enjoy online music streaming services back in 1997. What was different in 2007 was just how much had converged by then. It’s even more converged now as we enter 2017.Thinking back a little over 20 years ago, to enjoy music streaming required a few things. Well… it actually required quite a few things before audio bliss reached your ears.1997: Life in the &quot;Fast&quot; Lane( Yes yes yes… I’m setting aside UNIX sox and Linux xmms users wearing suspenders and reading glasses as they view this update from a terminal running alpine/sup/mutt… 😉 ) If you owned a Windows PC in 1997 you needed to have:a (then) fast connection to this thing called the InternetT1 (~1.5 Mbps) access was what kept you “at work” past 5pm 😁ADSL (~ 0.5 Mbps) was just coming to the masses in the USISDN (~ 0.128 Mbps) at home was (still) a big deal perk back then in the USa working Ethernet carda working sound cardan operating system (Windows 95/97) that didn’t periodically just stop working with one or more of these cards. a special software application installedlike RealAudio or WinAmpbtw… that didn’t come with the operating system by defaultYeah. Lots of things could go wrong but when it went right… it was pretty close to magical. That was computing in the late 1990s.Or, you bought a Mac and just waited for one of these when things.Oh… As for mobile phones in 1997, well… they had a quite a ways to go unless you grew up watching Star Trek on a black and white TV. You couldn’t take photos with a mobile phone at that point. That would actually take another three years or more depending on who you ask.2007: Life in the &quot;Foist&quot; LaneYes. In 2007 there were physical keyboards on phones.By 2007, you could open a web browser on just about any laptop or desktop, do a quick web search, and hear music online. It was almost a given that the machine was networked by Ethernet or WiFi and connected to high speed broadband of some variety. Things basically just worked when it came to computers. Oh, and now there are things called netbooks.As for mobile phones it was all about feature phones, if you were a Sprint subscriber you could even access Pandora from a mobile phone. That was pretty amazing back then.Two years later Pandora came to BlackBerry. Of course, by then a few mobile consumers had already moved on to this thing called an ‘iPhone\" that a lot of pundits and industry titans scoffed at loudly.What the iPhone represented was the convergence of multiple purpose built devices into a single form factor, a single service, and for a time, a single carrier that was foisted upon the subscriber. That’s right. The iPhone was all about exclusivity was the domain of AT&amp;T.2017: Life in the &quot;Feisty&quot; LaneAs we enter 2017, it’s amazing to think about what you can do on a smart phone. Things are a bit feisty now and the number of choices are only just beginning.Convergence has been embraced in our devices, in how we think about the back end systems that power the experiences made possible by and on those devices, and in our collective consumer expectations. It all should “just work” in ways that would have seemed like actual science fiction in 1997.Right now, you have far less parts but oddly enough… quite a few choices to make: DeviceiPhoneAndroid deviceA netbook, laptop, or yes… a desktopConnectivity“free” WiFi broadbandWiFi on paid broadband (or Ethernet)Carrier 4G/LTEAT&amp;TVerizonSprintT-Mobilea growing number of MVNOsApp (Service)PandoraSpotifyApple MusicTidaland many many more niche services with each passing yearOh, and as for the 1997 era magic moment… in 2017 you can share that music moment with just about anyone, anytime, and anywhere. It can be as simple and manual as sending a tweet that will pull anyone on the planet into the same experience you are having or you can opt to have automatic updates sent without you even having to be conscious of it.So, here’s to what will come in 2037 in the next two decades to come in “streaming music” becoming even more magical. Until next time… turn it up!","categories": [],

Thanks for sticking around and Happy New Year!2007: Life in the &quot;Foist&quot; Lane (continued)As I was saying… the way we consume music is changing due to convergence BUT I left a VERY important device! As we entered 2007, there was a steady rise of embedded computing that has slowly taken away the qwerty keyboards that are visually associated with computers. One example that got a lot of attention a decade ago was the humble but ill fated Chumby! A chumby could stream all your favorite Internet music streaming stations.The time of the internet connected computing capable appliance had arrived. Thanks Chumby!Chumby - Wikipediaen.wikipedia.org&ndash;ShareLittle. Alarm clock sized. Always connected.I also missed mentioning the rise of a new category of converged connectivity in 2007 that combined mobile access to IP networks with a localized WiFi service. These devices were accurately dubbed hotspots. These hotspots found their way into offices, homes, and even cars… Hmmm… cars….Mobile broadband modem - Wikipediaen.wikipedia.org&ndash;ShareA mobile broadband modem, also known as a connect card or data card, is a type of modem that allows a laptop, a personal computer or a router to receive Internet access via a mobile broadband connection instead of using telephone or cable television lines. A mobile Internet user can connect using a wireless modem to a wireless Internet Service Provider (ISP) to get Internet access.2017: Life in the &quot;Feisty&quot; Lane (continued)Again… As I was saying… consuming music over the past 20 years is changing due to convergence BUT I left off at ANOTHER very important kind of device! To recap:As we enter 2017, it’s amazing to think about what you can do on a smart phone. Things are a bit feisty now and the number of choices are only just beginning.Convergence has been embraced in our devices, in how we think about the back end systems that power the experiences made possible by and on those devices, and in our collective consumer expectations. It all should “just work” in ways that would have seemed like actual science fiction in 1997.Right now, you have far less parts but oddly enough… quite a few choices to make:DeviceiPhoneAndroid deviceA netbook, laptop, or yes… a desktopNow, we already know I missed both appliances and hotspots… What I also missed was the expansion of the connected device appliance to come with… wheels.Gary Numan - Cars - YouTubewww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareSuggested soundtrack for this digest…Think about cars for a moment. Go ahead. Hit play on the link.Clearly, cars existed in 1997. Cars also existed in 2007. Listening to music in a car is just part of growing up in a world where cars existed.You could even make the case that one of the major expansions of applied technology in 2007 was the creation of an entire category of geolocation services that went from fleet management vehicles (vans, delivery trucks, etc.) into our pockets as Apps such as Dodgeball and Foursquare.On the flip side of connectivity and all things mobile, 2007 also saw the rise of a category of networking devices called hotspots but also better known as mobile access routers by networking folks (which, again, I missed in my prior digest).What this means for cars in 2017 is even more convergence. Cars are often the subject of Internet of Things (IoT) discussions because they are accessible examples that many people use.You’ve probably heard that a modern car could send as much as multiple terabytes of data ever day to the cloud. You’ve probably also heard that we were promised jet packs. Somewhere in the middle is probably accurate though. But we’re getting off course…Music!Cars will produce a lot more information but let’s take this back to music. Appliances are not laptops or desktops but again let’s take this back to music. We want to listen to music.Well, in 2017… we have a lot of options… and things are feisty right now.Now you can use various handheld tablets, netbooks, laptops, computers, and even more thanks to music listening cabable appliance form factors.Google Home – Made by Googlemadeby.google.com&ndash;ShareHands-free help from the Google Assistant.

Maybe.Broken WingsMr. Mister - Broken Wings - YouTubewww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareSuggested soundtrack for this digest…&quot;Travel data: fraud with booking codes is too easy.&quot; FAQs about PNR hacking &amp; today&#39;s demo of CRS vulnerabilities: https://t.co/R5kVlcaM4e -- Edward Hasbroucktwitter.com&ndash;ShareA great read for all the #RoadWarrior types out there. Reminder: Yes, this is the year 2017. https://t.co/Cz3dBo7TtFMy career has been that of a global road warrior for the past few decades. Much of my travel has been using airlines and when I came across this YouTube video I was reminded of the illusions and security theater of modern commercial aviation. Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? Becoming a secret travel agent [33c3]www.youtube.com&ndash;ShareEye opening.Coverage is starting to pickup on this topic of these long running systems too. Just take a look at at the aggregation over at Techmeme.Techmeme: Researchers: ID codes printed on boarding passes, luggage tags for ~90% of flights let hackers access travelers&#39; personal info, steal reservations, more (Matthew Humphries/PC Magazine)www.techmeme.com&ndash;ShareThe essential tech news of the moment. Technology’s news site of record. Not for dummies.Now, to be clear, none of this information is really that new but there are some spit take moments for people that tend to assume “someone must be working on fixing that”. Of course there are modernization efforts underway but the reality is those modernized results are not realized at the moment.In fact, I was just tweeting about how much has changed in the past 20 years in how we interact with simple paper forms… well… those still exist too.  My point was that – the ability to modernize is still worth ongoing pursuit.Another OCR ERP shoe drops...1997: Paper forms -&gt; Raster scans -&gt; Mainframe -&gt; Jacada -&gt; Web2017: @HyperScienceAIhttps://t.co/EbRcMXvXKAtwitter.com&ndash;ShareSo, perhaps this same AI will be applied as a sort of human travel arranger arbitrage in the same clunky ways telephony IVR attempted to frustrate us until advising we press 4 to speak to an actual human. We’ll see.What is going to happen in aviation is wider interest in specific areas relating to convergence within the consumer workflow. It will also get feisty as we see attempts to block out access or control access to information feeds.For example, in the consumer space, you could probably write several essays for and against the ways in which API ecosystems and information feed access impacted the online services we use today. Just look at Twitter and their ongoing and shifting relationship with developers. Air travel is going to see innovation come bigger companies or smaller companies consumed by bigger companies. Think about Google who now owns ITA and offers Google Flights. Consider SAP who owns Concur which owns TripIt. TripIt was interesting because they were one of the first successful companies to aggregate frequent flyer miles for consumers. Of course, for TripIt that didn’t last long as the systems that made such aggregation possible took on new terms of access from several carriers.What convergence will look like in air travel will come down to how our personal preferences are brought to the travel experience. So, as odd as it might sound, one type of personal preference could include adding in security considerations.Modern travel booking applications for the web support travel arrangers. What if that travel arranger was an AI? What if you could start with AI for common requests but have a fallback to a human for review? Or, perhaps you just say you don’t want anyone to have access to anything besides you the carrier… and whatever number of third-parties deemed “okay” by that carrier.Whatever does take place, the convergence will likely mean the interaction requirements will be drastically simplified so that when you call or use an application, some credentials or factors for authentication will proceed your wait time experience. Anything that improves the timeline between a travel desire and carrier revenue will be up for grabs.Pockets of that convergence exist today but they are really crude. Caller ID (setting aside a spoofing debate for the moment) is the most conspicuous one. Then again, there are brittle areas here as reliance upon legacy IVR functions like proper DTMF handling can often be less than uniform.The Google Voice and DTMF issue is back again too. http://t.co/dm5A5RipVstwitter.com&ndash;ShareThe poor state of uniform DTMF support in bad IVR design likely means the AI voice bots will bring discombobulated malaise to the masses.twitter.com&ndash;Share2016 telephony trends:phone = buggy &quot;app&quot;DTMF = brokenvoip trunks = race to zeroIVR = badvoice prompts = worseAI/ML (hype) = worst☎=💀twitter.com&ndash;ShareSo, in summary… security will become important and placed into improvements of the system when it is part of the personal preference of the consumer. Those improvements in the system will take the form of convergence in that we won’t have to remember something or have something to get what we want… sitting in a chair in the sky.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;Thanks for reading. At this rate, I’ll be creating these nightly for publication in the early morning. Looking Back &amp; Looking Ahead Cleaned my desk area and found this relic of 2010... my how time flies!I’ve maintained a website of some form or anther for more than 20 years. My blogging (when that term was coined) has been sporadic depending on what I was doing career wise at the time. As the Web developed, so did the distractions of namespace on properties I did not control. Sometimes it just seemed easier to make it another platform’s problem to manage. Thankfully, I never had an animated glitter background on MySpace. *whew!*Still, even as I tap this update into Revue I’m reminded of how many years I’ve been making updates as an annual event. For example, I’ve provided updates on my roles with the company that is now a part of Dell EMC.My Sixth Year at VCE and My Sixth Week at Dell EMCjaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareMy Fifth Year at VCEjaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareMy Fourth Year at VCEjaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareMy Third Year at VCEjaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareMy Second Year at VCEjaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareMy First Year at VCEjaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareWhat hasn’t changed is the experimentation with different ways to present the blog. In fact, I’m still considering what I’ll do for 2017 with the rendering side of the workflow. We’ll see.I just got my $1.11 bill from @cloudfoundry and I&#39;m wondering how much it will be to move over my blog from @github pages completely.twitter.com&ndash;ShareThat tweet was from 2015. So, clearly I’m a bit behind on this goal. Then again, I’m sensitive to the ongoing monthly cost of maintaining a blog. Hence, using my GitHub repository as a means to accomplish already paid for blog hosting.I’ve flirted with Ghost, Hugo, and a few other approaches but I keep coming back to the low cost and near bulletproof use of GitHub Pages. At this point, all of the features are gems and allowing the flat file rendering to be done without my involvement.One thought I had was to crowdsource or use AMT / Upwork (Elance) / et al to “hire” editors to clean up all the spelling and formatting issues by simply having them do pull requests. Yet, that hasn’t happened.WordPress was probably one of the worst experiments I’ve tried in maintaining a blog. Partly, this is because I derived more pleasure from maintaining the LAMP stack and WordPress than I did actually writing.That notion of avoiding the maintaining has made me reconsider but not actually make a move to Medium. Jay Cuthrell 🤓💡🚀☁ – Mediummedium.com&ndash;ShareRead writing from Jay Cuthrell 🤓💡🚀☁ on Medium. #iwork4Dell on Converged Platforms and Solutions in @DellEMC (aka VCE) of @DellTech. Open DM texts calls emails: ☎️ 4157638343 📧 jay.cuthrell at dell dot com.When I think about the convergence of all the publishing and collecting and curating I’m trying to achieve (with any blog or microblogging format) it all boils down to how do I aggregate and how do I guarantee I have some control over my published materials. This, however, is easier wished than found as a toolset or methodology.One method is to commit to a single CMS and then leverage plugins or syndication to funnel all third-party updates into a consistent stream. Yet another approach is to set up an IFTTT recipe for everything and agree upon a lowest common denominator for central collection. Unfortunately, each of these has warts.So, will there be a convergence of activity streams? Will this be mere aggregation? Will there be annoyances as different services cooperate then decide to break embedded media conventions?It is difficult to say in these feisty times. Yet, I do think that convergence will come to our publishing and data creation. Partly, I’m encouraged to see articles that place the computing power closer to the person as a long term outcome.The End of Cloud Computing on Vimeovimeo.com&ndash;Share“I’m going to take you out to the edge to show you what the future looks like.” So begins a16z partner Peter Levine as he takes us on a “crazy\"…On the other hand, there will also be unique and fierce independent views on how personal computing can be made personal once again. A few that I find interesting are Diaspora, SeaFile, and Keybase. Release diaspora* 0.6.2.0 · diaspora/diaspora · GitHubgithub.com&ndash;Sharediaspora - A privacy-aware, distributed, open source social network.GitHub - haiwen/seafile: File syncing and sharing software with file encryption and group sharing, emphasis on reliability and high performance.github.com&ndash;Shareseafile - File syncing and sharing software with file encryption and group sharing, emphasis on reliability and high performance.Keybasekeybase.io&ndash;SharePublic key crypto for everyone, publicly auditable proofs of identity.Convergence in the space of activity streams will be fascinating. On the one hand, an “it just works” outcome is usually associated with very tightly integrated hardware, software, and services. On the other hand, much of the activity stream today crosses boundaries of services, devices, and even software specific “verbs” where sharing and publishing have very silo specific meaning. So, to wrap up, what convergence will mean in the future is a way to look back very quickly an easily with rich context and a way to project or look ahead. If there is AI or ML put into place it will be behind the scenes from a user experience point of view. Brittle meta data of today will simply not be of as much consequence due to the richness of enclosures that conform to an agreed upon standard that is universally demanded by everyone.In short, the future may already be here… and eventually consistent.","categories": [],

SxSW is absolutely MASSIVE.Here are just a few Interactive events that caught my eye:AI and Deep Learning Tech – Are We Ready?Why Women in Tech MatterBiopunk: Subverting BiopoliticsGet a Warrant: The 4th Amendment and Digital DataGoing Beyond Moore’s LawIEEE and PCI Future of the Internet MeetupSatellites: A Truman Show for EarthThe Internet of Things You Don’t OwnAs you can probably tell by reading about a few of these panels, there is an element of convergence that runs through them. That’s why I like going to SxSW. You aren’t getting a vendor specific pitch. Instead you are getting a mix of inputs from a variety of sources.Do some companies dominate and use PR firms to get their panels accepted and promoted into the lineup? Sure.Do attendees have to listen? Nope. That’s the best part. You get to vote with your feet! See also: The Geek Whisperers podcast Episode 27Episode 27 – The Balkanization of Tech Conferences and the Long Tail of SWAG | The Geek Whisperersgeek-whisperers.com&ndash;ShareThat’s why SxSW still matters. It’s not about one specific company dominating the sessions and content. Are there sponsors advertising and subsidizing everything? Sure. But again, you listen and consume what you want on your own agenda.The Distant Past(e)I’ve attended SxSW going back to 2008. I met enough folks that even captured some of my more interesting facial hair moments just before I joined Acadia -&gt; VCE -&gt; EMC -&gt; Dell EMC. 😂Impressions of SXSW 2010www.youtube.com&ndash;ShareThat was probably one of the thickest goatees I’ve ever had… good times. The shiny head hasn’t changed much though. 👴🏼This interview was done in early 2010, I was coming in from a telecommunications and VoIP background. Oddly enough, I even managed to work the word “converging” into the interview.One of the companies I mentioned was SlideRocket. It’s a small world because SlideRocket eventually went on to be acquired by VMware. Of course, I didn’t know that would happen then. Cool team!At the end, I mentioned the importance of a digest of emails. So if you are reading this digest, you can probably appreciate the appeal of a digest format.Ultimately, the convergence of interactive, music, and film concepts would play out each year and my decade long perspective isn’t far off now. I’m looking forward to writing about that in a future digest.One final note… if you are curious about the music selections I’m looking forward to seeing just start with this tweet and I’ll keep replying as I find new or interesting artistsThe listening has started... https://t.co/gIO7tvQUiytwitter.com&ndash;Sharesource: https://twitter.com/JayCuthrell/status/816142856775757824","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;Yesterday, I had my first immersive VR experience. It was the total package. Headgear. Trackers. Haptics. Consoles. Rigs. Probiotic Yogurt. Honestly, I’m not sure why I waited so long to try this. Yes, my mind was suitably blown.  Let’s start the digesting…Picture of the VR advert at Capital Factory in Austin, TexasGreat @CapitalFactory @CFVRLab @OwlchemyLabs demos today.🤓🕶😎👽My mind is now officially blown.AMAZING! #AR #VR https://t.co/Sl4W0mwFxYtwitter.com&ndash;ShareSilver Screen SQUID ApproximationsGrowing up in North Carolina, “Brainstorm” was one of those science fiction movies you heard more about in the local news than you did from people that went to see it in a theater. Most folks I grew up with saw it on HBO when cable came to our neighborhoods. Filming locations included all the places that would be part of my youth. The Outer Banks, Research Triangle Park, and various university settings were literally the backdrop for science fiction.Brainstorm (1983) - IMDbwww.imdb.com&ndash;ShareBoy meets Girl. Girl gets her cerebral cortex recorded.Strange Days (1995) - IMDbwww.imdb.com&ndash;ShareEnjoy the 900 MHz wireless phones of the “future”.“Strange Days” is also science fiction but it is a bit darker and edgier compared to the magical wonder of “Brainstorm”. The filming locations are right in the backyard of Hollywood. Some of those locations I’ve visited in my career.Now, are either of these movies about VR? Not exactly.In avoiding spoilers, the primary plot device in both movies (for me at least) was the notion of recording and playing back the experiences of the brain using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Both involved computing and storage device media so as my career has involved computing and storage oriented companies for the past several years – very amusing in retrospect.Both movies were a riff on the rise personal media recording starting with the humble VCR of the 80s and the eventual DVD of the 90s. In both tales, a person could record the total immersive experience they are having (their reality) and then that same person OR another person could experience it again – everything see hear smell touch everything – because the SQUID was doing both recording and playback by accessing brainwaves. In effect, this is passive viewing of an immutable and durable experience.Control and the ConstructIf you are reading this digest, I’ll go out on a limb and guess that you’ve seen at least one if not all of “The Matrix” trilogy or failing that, perhaps the holodeck from “Star Trek: The Next Generation”.Constructmatrix.wikia.com&ndash;ShareA Construct is a virtual work space or “loading program” created to run simulations or upload…Holodeckmemory-alpha.wikia.com&ndash;ShareA Holographic Environment Simulator, or holodeck for short, was a form of holotechnology…In terms of where VR is today visually, it’s not “The Matrix” by a long shot. Rather, it’s probably capable of reaching somewhere in the range of “Polar Express” uncanny valley creepy though.The experiences will improve as demand generation puts more VR headsets and peripherals into the hands of a new generation of gamer, trainer, and entrepreneur. Combined with advances in computing and networking speeds, things are going to get feisty.So, the natural question would be where convergence fits into place. For me, I look back to the SQUID of “Strange Days” and even “Brainstorm”.Convergence in VR will be interesting for several areas:High end headsets will be replaced by an affordable SQUID that might not be too far off from donning a fashionable hat (hey, it can’t be worse than when folks were Bluetooth earpieces)Processing units for the VR experience that currently require tower size gaming rigs will be replaced by ultra portable devicesA lessening of dependency on the current accoutrements will allow a user to be paired with biologically sound interfacessub dermal SQUIDhaptic implantationSoftware improvements obviating psycotropics (to get past algorithmic challenges for suspension of disbelief) will give rise to blending of VR and augmented reality (AR) without the need for glassesAs for the convergence of the physical impacts of a VR or AR experience I can see a couple of possibilitiesBounded experience areas requiring a user to stay in a flat grid will be replaced with active surfaces and other logically configured physical environments (approaching the holodeck concept)A passive physical posture will be more desirable and “The Matrix” approach of stimulation will mean the user just stays in a fixed position.Will experiences be available in a RedBox kiosk like DVDs and games are today? Will experiences be massive downloads like with a movie from Netflix? Will we be able to stream an experience? Can I subscribe to a bundle of experiences? Will experiences have discount codes if I subscribe to a series of experiences on retail’s digital Black Friday?These are all great questions to ask. As the consumer experience dictates, the convergence will arrive to satisfy a scenario where “it just works”.Lastly, as a reminder… convergence will also apply in how we communicate and share experiences and improve upon the pursuit of refinements in developed skills. It’s already happening now on the edges of the IT and skills continuum. Soon these new training methods will coming to a consumer retail ready experience near you and the people you know and probably sooner than you think.Enhanced Training Through Neurostimulationwww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareSoon…In fact, yesterday I did some on the job training of my own!

Sometimes I’ll find a familiar area and learn a bit more about an area that I have brushed up against in my past.Literally standing on the shoulders of giants (of research)Simulation is Good for the SoleWhen I went to college in the early 1990s it was for materials science and engineering. Back in those days, you could buy tennis shoes that would last longer than the fashion statements they made.One area of materials science and engineering is the study of polymeric systems. Plastic? Yep. But there’s more to polymers than just plastic. You contain polymers, such as, DNA.I remember grad students that studied polymers. Everyone on campus had access to DECstations (and uhm… QBATCH) , Mac SE’s, and sometimes Windows 3.1 towers that would have IEEE or other cards to interface with LabView and the like. Some of those grad students even used computers as part of their research for the purposes of simulation. One common approach to computational physics is the Monte Carlo method. Back in those days, what you would think of as high performance computing (HPC) was probably a trip up the road to see the Cray… unless you had a SLIP account… but I digress.GNU ShoesSimulation tools have come a long way since the mid 1990s. In fact, there are even open source options when it comes to getting your feet wet or committed to hard edged research.GNU MCSimwww.gnu.org&ndash;ShareFREE SOFTWARE!Comparing Consensus Monte Carlo Strategies for Distributed Bayesian Computation    research.google.com&ndash;ShareFun reading material.Google Research has done interesting work and published quite a bit of material on how they use various algorithms (like Monte Carlo, et al) and combinations of techniques to extend the body of knowledge in everything from networks to so-called deep learning. Reading their published materials is a real treat and a testament to how Google gives back to the wider scientific computation community as well.Tread a Fine LineSo, how would one see the convergence in shoes and computational simulations of polymeric systems? Well, block copolymers are very interesting. You can think of them like customized polymers that open various design options due to their unique properties.If you’ve bought a pair of sneakers recently then you know the prices are approaching levels of… well… they are getting spendy! Those sneakers are also highly collectible and valuable as well. Unfortunately, our material world does not last forever. As such, the fashion that does not last may be reflected in the pricey sneakers that also do not last. But it doesn’t have to be this way. So, it stands to reason that this market is going to get really really feisty as well.The Sneakerheads Racing to Save Their Kicks From Decaywww.wired.com&ndash;ShareI don’t usually link to Wired but when I do there is probably a good reason.Cool RunningFirst, imagine having access to top notch block copolymer researchers with deep understanding of how to leverage computational modeling and simulation to make the PERFECT set of kicks. Oh, and these reserachers know where to go for their high performance computing (HPC) needs.    High Performance Computingwww.dell.com&ndash;ShareYes. I’m biased. 🤓Next, imagine that you can create a collectible and highly sought after pair of sneakers for a market that seeks a guaranteed set of unique properties and you have the means to control production and set price. And what if they lasted a long time too and your investment was protected from premature degradation? Pretty cool, right?Here’s where the convergence comes into focus on the consumer experience once again. Imagine going from your wish of perfect kick to your actually shipped overnight perfect set of kicks. Convergence in this instance will be an example of “it just works”. Finally, imagine that you get to pick specific attributes from the block copolymer that will form your shoes – and you aren’t just picking from A, B, C, or D options… you get full sliders to control the just in time allocation of the copolymerization itself! You will truly have custom made long life shoes in every sense of the process.We’re not that far away from that possibility and the first steps towards this converged path are only a few clicks away.

Will there be software required to keep track of the licensing of the software?

        "excerpt":"I started this post ten days ago. The year since my last work related update has been packed with integration activity, organizational changes, epiphanies, and a fair amount of travel. The Patent I’ve gone through the patent filing process before at other companies but never had a grant. Until now. As of June 20 2017, I am named in a granted patent: 9684539 w00t!!!! Origin Stories As of this October update, I’ve been with Dell EMC (Converged) for seven years. As I described last year, the only reminders and references to VCE are few and far between. As an aside, I still wonder if my Acadia email address will stop working at some point.  The steady progression towards a Dell EMC experience has been a testament to the execution of the Dell EMC integration planning. Each week seems to bring a new update on the work that our CIO and IT group have completed and continue to complete. It’s taken time, but the VCE references, and eventually EMC references, gave way to Dell EMC references. The Road While the past year has not been as travel intensive for me as in prior years (90% travel), there were some highlights and welcome changes. Of the 52 weeks since my last October update, I appear to have traveled ~30 of those weeks. So, 60-70% travel seems about right. Highlights from the past 12 months include industry events such as Splunk .conf, Garther Data Center Conference, HIMMS, VMworld, Gartner Symposium ITXPO, Dell Technologies IQT Day, and 2017 Dell Analyst Day. Additionally, each month brought multiple Executive Briefings in Hopkinton, Santa Clara and in Round Rock. So, the best part is I was able to speak, conduct panels, and meet with lots of customers, partners, analysts, and global team members. The Topics If you read this far, maybe you are curious about the trends for meetings and the topics. Did meetings discuss what Dell Technologies is? Yes. Did meetings discuss how the transition to Dell EMC is going? Yes. Did other topics shift from what you thought they would be? Yes. Examples? Let’s see… Converged Infrastructure (CI) is now about as provocative as the status quo reference architectures it displaced several years ago. CI “just works” and has fewer objections to overcome in IT landscapes where LAN and SAN connected compute/storage paradigms persist. However, the single most requested topic of discussion was not converged infrastructure (CI). Nope. The top spot for topics was hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI). The next most requested topic? Hybrid cloud -on- HCI. Basically, an operating model delivered on a software defined basis was the topic that shifted to a PaaS storyline. Eventually, software defined operations will emerge as a topic or simply be an enabler to the next topic. I’m not sure though. The problem space is not solved. In general, this topic will require HCI penetration and growth to raise the base assumptions of automation within connecting fabrics. To recap the top 5 topics:   HCI  IaaS on HCI  CI  PaaS on HCI  Roadmaps on [REDACTED]HCI grew faster than many industry watchers expected. However, HCI (like CI before it) alone is not enough to move an industry forward outside lowest levels of IT infrastructure. Instead, forward progress in the higher IT stack will require greater adoption of PaaS and modern workforce organizational models as a path to writing better and more secure software more reliably more of the time. So… Hope springboots eternal? [REDACTED] Previously, I was ambiguous about what Dell EMC would be working on for customers… that I could write about on my blog. As it turns out, that has not changed. Dell EMC is part of Dell Technologies and the Marketing organization creates far more content than I ever could alone on a personal blog. As a result, 99% of what I create or share now is “behind the firewall” and that is absolutely fine. So, until next time… see you next year. :wink: ","categories": [],

Even my 24 year old high tech nomad self would wonder who this guy is that claims to be me. Great Changes After my last post, my role changed. I transitioned and started to assist in preparation for new business growth. Then my role changed again in January of this year. This time I also transformed completely to only new things. For the past 9 months I’ve been 100% focused on new things. The biggest changes were very welcome changes. So, I’ll go into a few of the changes that stand out for me personally. The New Duties Last year I took time to complete modules of curriculum in my career path. Some of my chosen curriculum centered on managing change, communicating change, and leading through change. Looking back, I’m glad I completed these modules. My days and weeks are far more structured since January of this year. I’m razor focused on products and operations. The topics and time lines are different than being an Office of the CTO. Developing KPIs, metrics, and measuring the efficiency of an engineering organization is rewarding. Engineering a product is truly a team effort. So, in many ways, I’m able to tap into the experiences from my prior time as a VP, GM, CTO, and managing software and system engineering groups back in the day. The Lack of Road Anyone that really knows me would probably say I’m a frequent work traveler. Looking back, I have travelled a couple million miles for work. I’m still incredibly thankful for having those opportunities. However, in January of this year, I was offered the chance to give my travel bags a rest. I took the chance. How has it been? In a word? WONDERFUL. In fact, Dell’s Legacy of Good Plan allowed me to enroll in flexible work programs. That makes me a proud member of the 58% of team members that do not commute into a traditional office. Losing elite travel status was not a big deal because I don’t have to be in planes as much. However, I did try the matching program with American Airlines using my Delta Diamond status. RIP Virgin America. I still miss Singapore Airlines. For me, only lounge access, re-booking, and dedicated call queues are primary differentiators for air travel with major US based carriers in the year 2018. Then again, my pleasure travel since January of this year has been more direct flights so that is always preferable to the risk of connections. Yes, I’m soaking this “travel when you like” lifestyle up while I still can. It’s been really nice. The Road Ahead Do I think this will change in 2019? Yes. Probably. A lot. Have I prepared? Also, yes. After two years in Austin closer to the Round Rock mother ship, I’ve relocated near a bigger airport with more direct routes. AUS airport will probably be amazing by 2021 but I’m expecting to be back in the air again soon and I like having more options. In addition to Trusted Traveler Programs, this year I’ve also picked up U.S. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in anticipation of my travel schedule and destinations changing dramatically. [REDACTED] As for what has not changed, I still really cannot blog about what I am working on for customers. But maybe I’ll show up elsewhere in a company sanctioned online presence. That said, I’ve moved off GitHub Pages to Netlify (see the footer below) and it has been outstanding. Maybe, as the failed promise goes, I will blog more now. Heh. One other area I’ve changed is maintaining other social media profiles. 10 years of Twitter was a good run. So, I’m not on Twitter unless someone DMs me. Once again, I’ve removed my LinkedIn profile. I might put a placeholder back in place. Maybe. I’ve tried to add a social media profile breadcrumb URL to link back to my website where possible. If not, I’ve removed the social media profile entirely. Welcome to the SSL enabled canonical source of my seemingly anti-social media updates! My 10 year prediction  Looking back, this past year has turned out to be a nuclear waste trash fire for a lot of social media services overall but I don’t claim that I saw it coming. Okay, maybe a little. The Public Cloud might be easier than it has ever been… but so has the ability to get it very very wrong. Shifting placement of workloads may confer certain financial envelope favorability but it does not magically shift placement of responsibility and accountability. Lately, it seems like the most consistent emails I get are from haveibeenpwned.com. If you reading this and know me, drop me a slightly more secure line here. So, until next time… see you later. :wink: ","categories": [],

        "title": "Twenty Years of Blogging",
        "excerpt":"20 years. Well, it’s probably more than 20 years if I include personal websites that changed. Good times. Selective Saving What I’ve saved over the years as a blog post has changed a lot. My most popular posts were only popular due to keywords. For example, anything that referenced Sender-Policy Framework was popular because SPF records probably appeared in the log files of frustrated email administrators. The most regular readers here are, by far, the crawlers. Crawlers to humans are probably around 100:1 at this point in the life of my blog. That’s the reality of 2018. Adding Dates When I had comments on my blog, it wasn’t uncommon to have someone keyword search on Google, Bing, etc. and end up here. Unfortunately, the date of my blog post wasn’t easy to see. So, the comments were from a perspective of here and now on a post squarely in the time and context of the original posting. I’ve long since removed comments posts but adding back the year as part of the post title was a riff on what HN does more often. My thinking was that if my content ever did make HN or a similar popular traffic site the comments would be in a context of the year the post was written. Data Loss WordPress made it easy to blog. WordPress made it easier to forget the implication of portability, data protection, and dependencies. Flickr made it easy to share photos in blog posts. Flickr made it easier to forget the implication of consistent anchors, URLs, and presentation when giving up control to a third-party with year over year corporate entropy of apathy. There are some great post I’ve made that were lost. Then again, much like any writer has a wadded up paper collection… I chalk up my losses to writing a better post later. Changing Needs When I was consulting and during the build up of Acadia / VCE the blogging was more vital to revenue. Now, there is structure and specialization and the need to be the scribe for a company is far less important. In fact, it might be easier to say that a personal blog is the worst place to talk about a company. There is no upside. It’s mostly downside. Ease of Posting Going from flat files to random perl based CMS to LAMP for WordPress was fun. I had several flirtations with Ghost, Hyde, Pelican, Hugo, etc. However, each time I tried to get away from Jekyll (still very much in use) there were caveats. Longer term, I’d like to get off of Jekyll for no other reason that just to learn new things to break. Go is interesting and I still get to play with python but I’d like to pick something that provides for a simpler workflow. Getting off of GitHub Pages meant going backwards a bit but it was how I also removed Google Analytics and other third-party CDN(s) from my approach. Establishing Contact After over a decade of Twitter, LinkedIn, etc… I’m trying other alternatives. These days, I try to use more secure messaging methods. Feel free to ping me anytime on Keybase, Signal, Wire, Telegram, or Confide. My contact information is available at my personal website: https://jaycuthrell.com/contact/ My LinkedIn profile is just a placeholder now. ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Google+ for most users will go away soon. April 2019 warnings and advice to export user data promted me to export my own. Memories of Wave I was a strong proponent of Google Wave. Yeah. I’m one of those people. Since I’m also a a G-Suite customer, I’m curious how parallel efforts within Google will impact Google+ for G-Suite. When Google Wave was just starting it was not top of mind that Google Wave might cease to be a stand alone service. By that time, many other Google Apps tools were becoming real-time. Real-time appealed to shared time windows where a concurrent collaboration was possible. In effect, the asymmetric tools became more symmetric. Granted, the notion of seeing multiple users editing the same document “in a web page” is more commonplace today even if the use case is… very edge case. Google Wave was by definition, wave ahead… way ahead of its time. Google Minus Google press coverage and punditry has crafted a story about how Google shuts down everything. Google built up a reputation for ending services. Then again, there was not a Google before there was a Google. If the only comparison was to and older company, like Yahoo, then the notion of ending services might not be so novel – it would be reasonable and expected. Google Pluses Speaking of April showers, it was only a few years ago (April 2015) that FriendFeed was shut down after Facebook helped it with long term strategic planning. Indeed, any commitment to running any service for any advertising company lasts only while there is model for monetization. As soon as there is a better model, the commitment shifts to any service that perpetuates the model. Or… without a model it is bye bye, baby, bye bye. However, Google G-Suite has a Google+ service that is, by defition, monetized by subscription services. So, the likelihood of Google+ service living on is more predictable. As long there are a significantly large enough number of enterprise customers using the Google+ service, it will continue. ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;This past week seemed to follow an augmented reality theme in the regular places I read. Techmeme, A16Z podcast, and even Hacker News provided multiple references to augmented reality, virtual reality, 5G ubiquity, and the widening adoption of gaming technologies.During recent trips on Lyft, the driver and passenger (me) conversations trended to technology discussions. I like to ask drivers if they are full time or part time with Lyft, Uber, or any other TNCs. One common theme was the prediction of when self-driving cars would be viable in any markets beyond denser and constantly mapped markets. My anecdotes were on ideally selected AZ to NV route shipping trucks that have been developed for decreased reliance upon high cost (i.e. experienced) drivers in favor of 4G/LTE connected call center hosted drivers, aggressively funded learning models, and monitoring driver experiences. My other anecdotal example was the controlled testing done in Las Vegas with Lyft.Self-Driving - Lyft - Passengerswww.lyft.com&ndash;ShareWhat happens in Vegas… eventually will happen everywhere else on a long enough timeline.The driver anecdotes focused on the cost of insurance and liability for new technology in vehicles and the growing body of evidence that self-driving vehicles are less prone to accidents than human driving vehicles.Perhaps we’ll see AR become the answer to all the problems we didn’t know we had. Getting human drivers comfortable with AR heads up display built into more dashboards and windshields might not be far away but seeing ourselves as jet fighter pilots is a flawed proposition. More distracted driving would be a bad thing. Instead, perhaps the AR for human drivers becomes the next advertising modality as we find the car driving itself and the human driver is merely along for the commercials played against the real world substrate passing them by.AR Will Spark the Next Big Tech Platform—Call It Mirrorworld | WIREDwww.wired.com&ndash;ShareOr, perhaps, this can be the best test construct possible for the things we aren’t willing to unleash in the real world that could easily end badly?Finding the right place to run a test will be a growing challenge as density of technology increases and ubiquity becomes more commonplace. The ideal routes will be harder to justify for longer term studies.In response, machine learning against non-disruptive data sets will grow rapidly. Unfortunately, the demand to grow will have challenges. Just as there have been calls for increased emphasis on STEM and recruiting talent into emerging technology areas we will face the challenge of any new industrial endeavor: quality control and societal considerations of the result from the quality in our day to day lives.

It’s probably reasonable to assume some of the ML uses and applications will be even more flawed.

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;The topic of quantum computing has steadily moved towards the realm of popular science. As with many other topics within popular science, wider audiences will have varying degrees of awareness and depth – but recognition is certainly on the rise.Let's get the TV reference out of the way...While I never got into the TV show, Quantum Leap is still one of the first things that come to mind when I hear quantum computing mentioned. That is until the Bond series displaced it. My first exposure to the topic came from early fascination with high(er) temperature 123 (YBa2Cu3O7) superconductive materials and getting to work as a lab grunt with postdocs that built SQUIDs.1989 - Quantum Leap Episode: Genesis - September 13, 1956www.nbc.com&ndash;ShareElectric car?

Today, “Synthetic Characters” are better known as the dystopian proof-of-concept known as “deep fakes” that many futurists claim will leave the uncanny valley of visual Fibonacci-esque fluid pattern recognition of faces.The Rest of the WorldTrying to gauge more general interests outside of Gartner clientele is a bit more challenging. Even Google Trends indicate that interest in quantum computing has risen and fallen over the years. Perhaps the least scientific way to gauge interest...Zeitgeist estimates aside, the steady uptick in searches for quantum computing would indicate more people wonder what quantum computing is about. Also, in just over 15 years, the interest in quantum computing has risen to the level of demand for summaries targeting CIOs. 2017 - The CIO&#39;s Guide to Quantum Computing - Smarter With Gartnerwww.gartner.com&ndash;ShareHype! Hype! Hype!The Anticipation of CommercializationSeveral companies have already appeared to market and associate with quantum computing.

Life back then involved analog recording rigs, tapes, heavy sound mixers, clunky snakes, speakers, monitors, amps, mics, and the investment of time to get it all right.This week I learned a little more about what has changed in the past 20 years.Look out for the SnakesRunning the snake was an occasional problem when the venue wasn’t purpose built for live music. For example, you are setting up in an open field and want to know the sound is great so you run the snake back to a console facing the stage. People want to dance when music is playing. Dancing is harder when when there are rugs, trenches, or other attempts to hide a gnarly cable from sight.Intro to Mixer and Basic live sound setup Pt. 6.1: Stage Snakewww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareWhen there are a lot of instruments and a desire for great drum sound there will be a lot of inputs. When there are a lot of inputs the snake gets thicker.

Next, the cost of high powered tablet computing meant access to often skeuomorphic  designs mimicking various physical consoles. So, if the engineers that tried Ethernet were really smart, the next wave of audio engineers were absolute geniuses. By using wifi the replace the physical Ethernet cable it meant the console could be just about anywhere anytime even between turnover of bands on lineup.How to use the BEHRINGER X32 remote app for iPad - XiCONTROLwww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareMobile console FTW!Most traditional snakes might have been 50 feet or 100 feet which is still well within the range of wifi.  That means you can be the sound person anywhere in the room. In fact, you can probably be the sound person just about anywhere the wifi signal can reach. But how would you communicate with the band through the monitors to get the sound dialed in just right? Simple. You’ll just need a mic with you while you have the tablet unless you have excellent signing capability or interpretive dance skills. You’ll want something rugged as you’ll be running around.

        "title": "Fudge Sunday - Road Warrior Redux",
        "excerpt":"&nbsp;If you follow my annual blog updates you already know I’ve been off the road for just over a year. As with any decrease in travel frequency there are opportunities to learn and plan for an eventual increase. This week I’ll explore some of the things I’ve learned over the past +20 years of being in regular motion around the globe.My office at the peak of my North American travel... the AMEX Lounge in LASMembership Had Its Privileges One of the early benefits of carrying around specific brands of credit cards in your wallet is airport lounge access. The idea was that for loyalty (and paying a yearly fee) there was a perk to allow subsidized access to the airport lounge of the carrier printed on the card or even a few different lounges (as with American Express).If you follow travel blogs or travel rewards forums then you also know that the math to keep up with changes in programs, perks, and entitlements is fast becoming 400 level math.Personally, I’ve carried around AMEX cards and Delta specific cards. However, there are fewer reasons to carry and more caveats than before as wider pools of participation occur through the wonders of corporate expense policy seeking to provide great perks year over year. Even my beloved American Express Centurion Lounge in Las Vegas was not immune to the spoils of its own success.Seriously.The 1st Wave: 1999-2006From 1999 to 2002 there was a lot of travel I signed up for as a global .com era consultant dealing with software and systems engineering or what was then called infrastructure engineering. Sometimes I would have down time and blog but most of it was pithy and ubiquitous connectivity like broadband was still just become a reality around the globe. Dial-up was pretty common unless you were in an office, had two channels of ISDN at home or the first of the xDSL or maybe even pre-DOCSIS cable internet services at home.Tel Aviv Traceroute ( 2000 )jaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareBecause it’s totally normal to blog about a traceroute?There was a time when a flight from RDU to EWR was $88 round trip on an airline that no longer exists. That year was 2001 and it was in the wake of 9/11.Here It Comes ( 2001 )jaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareIt was another time.Eventually, travel that was less normal became accepted as normal. You learned to expect more security and scrutiny or the random change to policy or procedures. Long live the freedom grope.Jay's Way Circa 2007The iPhone became reality in 2007. There were caveats that made it less than an ideal travel phone back then. For example, there was one carrier in those days if you wanted to have the iPhone.The year was 2007: Laptop. Wifi. Blackberry. Flip Phone.Around this same time, I was asked if I could describe the ideal road warrior approach. Luckily, I wrote it down so that I can now reflect on the assumptions and some of the absurdities through a lens some 12 years later.This is how to work from the road.1) Have access to a quiet place with no harsh overhead lighting, no screaming announcements, plentiful AC power, free scratch pads and pens, free drinks and snacks (Delta Crown Room via AMEX perks or buy one)2) Have access to quality wireless OR wired Internet (via T-Mobile pay as you go)3) Have a laptop and mobile phone.4) Have a backup mobile phone that uses the same type of storage card that can be read by the other phone and laptop.5) Have a land line with a DID.6) Have a 12V charger that lets you carry -one- kind of car charger per mobile phone7) Drink lots of coffee during layoversThis list seemed quaint until I reviewed my current carry on bag. (See below for the 2019). In fact, now I carry two laptops and two mobile phones on two different carriers and have memberships to two (or three) different lounges. I’m not sure if this is progress or simply refining my desired level of backup and redundancy options. Yes. That must be it.Jay's Way Circa 2010After semi-retiring and consulting for a few years it was getting easier to travel when I wanted and where I wanted. Broadband was really hitting stride and the number of companies innovating in streaming collaborative screen sharing were on the rise. It was a time when proxemics and being there were quickly becoming more than just a richer conference call.Airwaves vs Airlines ( 2010 )jaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareIn which I wondered if there was a better way to be there.Eventually, the patterns of modern audio, video, and screen based collaboration gave way to memes. The memes were funny because there was and is a root of truth to them.A Conference Call in Real Lifewww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareTrigger warning. :smile:Since 2010 the sheer number of miles I’ve traveled is staggering. Just becoming a Million Miler on one of the many carriers I fly was enough to remind me I should probably consider offsets or credits for my carbon footprint. Thankfully there are causes to make me feel better about my consumption. Also, I look forward to how I travel differently and smarter in the years ahead should I be fortunate enough to continue to travel be it for work or not work work.Jay's Way Circa 2019As I look ahead to 2019 and beyond, I’m learning that less is more and that planning ahead makes a huge impact on road warrior duties. So, what’s in my carry on bag these days?Two laptops. One for work. One for not work work.High wattage power adapater. Works for both laptops to ensure full performance and avoid stepping down the CPUs.Two mobile phones on two different carrier. One for work. One for not work work. Hotspot plans.Full size charging brick with cables for each phone.Three lounge memberships. Delta. American Airlines. AMEX Centurion.Brookhaven slim backpack or a larger padded Columbia backpack.The system for getting and traveling well has changed up quite a bit as well. The options available in 2019 are far different and far more convenient than 20 years ago.Lyft and the like obviate the need to drive a vehicle to the airport and pay for the right to dealing with parking deck fee payment kiosks. The math usually works out to be better for a trip of less than 3-4 days.If you are part of a global road warrior program through your workplace, go ahead and find the lounge you like vs the carrier you plan to fly most. Dietary considerations are important and knowing what lounges have good electrical and wifi coverage is more important than distance to your gate. Just remember that everyone else traveling like you probably has the same idea and crowding will continue as travel becomes less of a treat and more of an expectation. Most airports are large enough to be wonderful hiking from one end of the terminal to the next – and bonus points for having defibrillators and emergency response staff if you’ve fallen and can’t get up. The importance of a comfortable backpack is important. Check your big bag. Just check it. That means trusting the process of checking a bag… even I’ve learned that sometimes you win and sometimes you get dragged down the tarmac and delivered on baggage carousel in a smoldering heap of burnt leather and ripped wool. You can replace your shoes and pants. You can’t replace the freedom of a nice walk with a backpack through the terminal.National health club membership because poor hotel gyms aren’t an excuse not to get in gym time.Keyless checkin is still a bit of a gimmick but useful when you get into the hotel after front desk staffing levels are less than ideal. Else, get an actual card when you can and especially if it is proximity based vs. Wiegand code strip aka mag stripe style. Those mag stripe style cards still fail from all the magnets used in mobile phones.That's why all my measurements are on file at Men's Wearhouse.The Next Wave: 2020 and beyondThat’s all for now.

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;I’ve been using GitHub for ~10 years. Over time I used GitHub more socially than for source code publishing. As my use increased so did my bookmarking via the “stars” function. Let’s see what I kept after my most recent Spring purge of GitHub stars…JayCuthrell GitHub Starsgithub.com&ndash;ShareA list of all my GitHub stars sorted by popularityMy First GitHub RepositoryMy first GitHub repository was a trivially simple XML based web gadget that mapped the traffic cameras for the ATL and RDU area. The gadget was a Google Gadget for iGoogle (hah!) which launched in 2005 but I think I was hosting the snippets of code on my website prior to GitHub coming into existence. Good times circa 2007.Eventually, I moved all my coding projects to GitHub and even got to contribute a few times here and there. While I’ve never considered myself to be a good developer, I can sometimes apply myself. More accurately, I can configure and read documentation. That’s okay. I’m comfortable with that and appreciate the hard work others have published that I can use freely. So, the GitHub stars become a social gesture form of love letter from one perspective all while iGoogle faded into the past.iGoogle - Wikipediaen.wikipedia.org&ndash;ShareRIP iGoogle 2005-2013Startups, RSUs, and EquityTo be clear, GitHub is not exclusively about code repositories. In fact, when I was an advisor to multiple startups I was often looking for ways to politely say “no” when approached by founders. That led to a blog post and lots of bookmarking of other similar blog posts.Be My Advisor ( 2013 )jaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareThinking about equitable equity.Occasionally, I would come across a really strong blog post that educated the reader on startup topics.

The marketing promise was there but the next few years would see mixed results followed by a steady decline in use.Human Nets Digests, Volume 5 (1982)www.cs.rutgers.edu&ndash;ShareJust search for “AirFone”.Even CNN captured the promise in their own video coverage of passengers using cordless (wow!) handsets in some of the early demonstrations of the technology.The hype and promise of 1984 to 2008...CNN flashback: In-flight calls in 1984money.cnn.com&ndash;ShareFascinating look at the cordless telephone… in an airplane one way.My search led me to coverage of AirFone back in 2006.

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;When I started collecting links this week I had no idea how I would arrive at a conclusion. Thank goodness for the tech news cycle and, specifically, Techmeme. I’m already questioning my use of a newsletter service for reasons I hope to make clear below. Let’s get started.Go Your Own WayI don’t doubt a Fleetwood Mac reference is slightly dated at just over 40 years ago. Still, one thing I have noticed in my regular reading is a renewed interest in repatriation of content from centralized social platform juggernauts to more self-hosted options.March of 2008 is where interest piqued but has it peaked?So what happened in March 2018? Simple. Social media finally saw the culmination of unflattering coverage by both tech press and traditional media followed by a genuine reflection by a sizable number of users asking if there were alternatives. In fact, if you look back at tech press coverage on Techmeme from March 2018 you are immediately reminded of the zeitgeist that mashed up technology, politics, and economics.2018 - Techmeme Facebook coverage March 2018www.techmeme.com&ndash;ShareTechmeme is a great resource to understand the “on this day” view of tech press coverage.As the saying goes, reaction was swift. Social media was tarnished on a larger scale than ever before. However, another perspective is that wishing to leave as a meme was simply a popularization of what had existed for as many years as the lifetimes of the very services now considered harmful. It’s just a matter of changing perspectives with far larger numbers of users.Generalization of the DisdainWhile it might be simplistic to assign all concerns to a single social platform, it is just lazy. It is more accurate to assess that all centralized social media platforms that achieved massive scale and wide adoption were and are increasingly subject to scrutiny.Tweet like you mean it.Considering the ownership structure, this is very telling.Rising interest is rising. Alternatives to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.Rising Options and AlternativesLeaving a social media platform is often where the phrase “easier said than done” but just as MySpace was once a big deal, sometimes the lights flicker at the end of the show is a subtle foreshadow of another phrase “you don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here”.2019 - Myspace lost all photos, videos, and music its users uploaded between 2003 and 2015www.techmeme.com&ndash;ShareWhat?!?! Hey! It’s free! So… Oops?2019: Google shuts down and deletes all consumer accounts on Google+www.techmeme.com&ndash;ShareAllegedly as many as several people were very sad.If we’re keeping score, we now know that social media was not just where your information might be for sale, be associated with geopolitical imbroglios, etc… but there was the bonus of possibly having your most embarrassing digital items preserved forever in the public domain OR your most cherished digital items eventually lost forever.While mainstream attitudes to social media have evolved over the past +20 years, the longer term implications of participation are a growing body of concerns.1997 to 2019: The History of Social Mediagroupthree.web.unc.edu&ndash;ShareSix Degrees!Indeed, there are multiple alternatives and options to the centralized social platform juggernauts. Some alternatives are simply smaller centralized social platforms. Other alternatives, are more interesting approaches: self-hosted options with decentralized, federated, and distributed sensibilities. The diaspora* Projectdiasporafoundation.org&ndash;ShareThis was the original call to action from a team of academics that were way ahead of the curve.Ethical alternatives to popular sites and appsswitching.social&ndash;SharePointers to less centralized optionsThe Mastodon Project has appsjoinmastodon.org&ndash;ShareFederation approach vs. Distributed approachMovimmovim.eu&ndash;ShareAnother decentralized approach using XMPPAether grows past 500 concurrent nodesblog.getaether.net&ndash;ShareAnother example of nodes vs. centralized destinations.One Last DragAs I was wrapping up this collection of links, I was sure I could pull together the roll your own theme somehow but it wasn’t clear until the results of a recent social media poll were published earlier today.What wastes time, spreads lies, and divides us?www.techmeme.com&ndash;SharePlease retweet this. Oh wait.The final cherry on top took home the full double meaning and – came from social media. How? Roll your own is a phrase associated with rolling of cigarettes. Like cigarettes, social media has seen massive adoption but the side effects are just beginning to be considered. Patrick Moorhead on Twitter: &quot;We see similar behavior with smokers: I know it&#39;s bad for me and those around me, could lead to my early death, it costs others in medical costs, but I&#39;m going to keep smoking. 🚬… https://t.co/7czaEqKLBD&quot;twitter.com&ndash;ShareExactly.Then again, moving from centralized big social media to decentralized smaller social media might not be as healthy but the analogy so slowing your ability to smoke a pack a day might just be slowed down a bit by making it less expedient path to a direct dopamine hit. For a fun (dystopic?) thought exercise, consider the implication of so-called e-cigarettes and vaping against the post-tempest social media landscape of our rapidly approaching future. So, until next time, please don’t share this on social media. :wink:","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;Just over 20 years ago I met with investment groups that later turned into a new direction in my career. While the .com days were a mixed bag, some of the companies rolled up into other companies which continued to roll up into other companies. If anything, I’ve learned a lot about the long and sometimes winding path of nested mergers.The Right Angle TurnNortel Buys Bay Networks (1998)www.wired.com&ndash;ShareBecause Lucent and Cisco.My first merger was when Bay Networks was acquired by Nortel. By that time, it wasn’t that big a deal for the small Nortel group I worked in because we primarily used Cisco and Lucent technology already. Ooops.As such, we didn’t last long enough to have a forced integration that I can recall. In fact, the Nortel group I was in was getting shopped around to other potential buyers. As fate would have it, the technology briefings and M&amp;A teams led to me meeting the new people I would eventually work with for the next few years.Dot-Com DestinyBy 1999, web consultancies and digital agencies were smaller boutique shops known for interactive multimedia and cutting edge websites. Back in those days, systems administrators in a firm would support the content creation talent commonly known as webmasters. In fact, some agencies would even offer web hosting of this modern web content.My iXL Moment1999: When websites said &quot;This site is best viewed with Netscape 3.02 or later&quot;iXL was one of the growing web consultancies and it had acquired several digital agencies. While at Nortel, I had met iXL’s investors and some of the companies iXL acquired over the years.Some of the iXL team liked me. So, I joined iXL in 1999.At iXL, I literally traveled the world. It was a fire hose of new information to assimilate quickly. I learned a lot in a very compressed timeline.Competition and ConsolidationWe had competitors like Scient and Sapient. Scient had a clever landing page for their homepage so that if you viewed from a competitors known SWIP CIDR block (like from iXL HQ) you’d get their careers page. Cheeky.By 2001, the pressure to combine forces or merge in hopes of survival were a well known pattern. This was the Dot-Com bubble bursting.Winter had come. That cheeky web parlor trick company, Scient, would become iXL’s acquirer. We became the small red “i” in the Scient logo.Scient and iXL Merge (2001)www.computerworld.com&ndash;ShareMy second merger.I kept traveling. I kept working. Eventually both came to an abrupt halt. Like many folks during the dot-com burst, I learned about how to log into PACER and read legal documents.And for my next trick ( 2002 )jaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareGood times until they were not.Technically, I missed the opportunity to go into a nested merger. For that experience I’d have to wait another 14 years. Instead, I went on to have fun elsewhere and do other things.Aggregations and AcquisitionsSo, over the next 14 years I kept an eye on what Scient (iXL) had gotten up to and where the parts of the company ended up landing. Amazingly, the back and forth leads to unexpected combinations that seem almost like the lead up to 1999 all over again. SBI acquires Scient (2002)www.wsj.com&ndash;ShareChapter 11 and the SBI roll upSBI acquires Razorfish (2002)www.computerworld.com&ndash;ShareAnd the .com deals keep rolling upSBI sells Razorfish to aQuantive (2004)www.deseretnews.com&ndash;ShareThis feels like Three-card Monte of M&amp;A at this point.Publicis to Buy Digitas (2006)dealbook.nytimes.com&ndash;ShareHint: Keep an eye on Publicis.Microsoft buys aQuantive (2007)techcrunch.com&ndash;ShareBy this time, Microsoft was willing to pay $6B to get into this market… because of DoubleClick and Google.Publicis to Buy Razorfish (2009)www.wsj.com&ndash;ShareA few years later, Microsoft would write down most of aQuantive.Publicis Buys Sapient (2014)www.bloomberg.com&ndash;ShareIt’s like that old saying if you can’t merge with Omnicom, go shopping instead. And boy did they…Publicis creates SapientRazorfish (2016)adage.com&ndash;ShareCombined by a most circuitous route!Publicis Sapient is formed (2019)www.adweek.com&ndash;ShareShorter name. Bigger ambitions.Publicis to buy Epsilon (2019)www.techmeme.com&ndash;ShareAnd… $4.4B scene?Final ThoughtsIf you had told me in 1999 that the company I was working for would become part of the third largest communications company in the world, I might have been a tad skeptical. Still, what an amazing recreation of the consultancy roll up model over the course of 20 years. This time, however, the consultancy is now paired with massive advertising as well as far reaching data assets and targeting capabilities. Place your bets now on when older firms like WPP, Omnicom, and Publicis combine or adjust size in the top three listings. The relatively newer firms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are placing their own bets too.Amazon, Google, and Facebook (2019)www.bloomberg.com&ndash;ShareHundreds of $B are at stake. Expect spirited competition from the older big three and the newer big three.So, until next time, thanks for reading Fudge Sunday.","categories": [],

So awesome.Today, we live in a time where there are growing numbers of electric vehicles that promise to displace both hybrid vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles. While electric vehicles are seen as the future – there is absolutely a past and history repeating. For all the shouts of electric cars being the future, the past tells us when there is necessity the future already arrived long ago.  In fact, the past might only be at odds with planned obsolesce and other curious quirks of modern consumption.1912 - C-T 4WD Electric Truckbringatrailer.com&ndash;ShareIf you remember your first car, do you think it would run for 52 Years? How about 107 years?1947 - Tama Electric Carwww.nissan-global.com&ndash;ShareThe 1940s provided limitations that sparked innovation. (no pun intended)Remember, technology is the response to a perceived need. Necessity could be argued as being more than a perceived need but the epistemological view of 4WD trucks probably didn’t anticipate the world of SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY.The Case for HumansSelf-driving elevators are the future! Wait. Elevators? What about vehicles? Well, elevators still have their human driven examples even today.2018 - The Second Life of Elevator Operators: A Lesson in Service Designdesignobserver.com&ndash;ShareUses cases still exist for elevator operators where a human still performs tasks primarily associated with self-service buttons.Even as self-driving desires extend from the roadway to the open seas, there are going to be examples where the past more like is the future we desire.2007 - Tres Hombres Shippingwww.treshombres.eu&ndash;Share99% emission free transport sounds like something from the future but it is based on something from the past.As modern cargo ships evolve into the cargo ships of the future there will be geopolitical, economic, and then technological considerations. Expect to see solar, wind, hydrogen, and even nuclear become part of the self-driving ships of the future.At the same time, there are promises of self-driving vehicles on roadways and elsewhere that are fulfilled in very controlled and variable limited situations. 2018 - The Future of Autonomous Cargo Shipswww.historyinorbit.com&ndash;ShareAgain, AI/ML might not be as sensible as a human pilot for certain applications.2019 - Phantom Auto raises $13.5Mtechcrunch.com&ndash;ShareSelf-driving forklifts and robotaxis might take a long time. Meanwhile, training data can be collected in anticipation and to quicken the process.General self-driving vehicles are not yet a reality even by Gibson’s definition. Until then, the training will continue as the machines attempt mimicry and to learn.The Case for Movies and GamingEach year brings greater degrees of cinematic largess to electronic gaming even as movies attempt new formats. Contrasting early pong graphics and sound against the audio-visual splendor of modern games is just one example.  Movies like Hardcore Henry are an example of movies influenced by electronic gaming first-person point of view. 1998 - BNL - It&#39;s All Been Donewww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareAnd the 2049 Academy Award for Best Cinematography by a Pet goes to… Perhaps the next wave storytelling device of cinema might be influenced by Twitch or music videos from 20 years ago. Perhaps the experimental cinema of yesterday becomes de rigueur. 1999 - Being John Malkovichwww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareA portal into the life of another person sounds like a good idea for a video game… oh wait.Then again, the future might simply decide to take a page from the past both metaphorically and literally.  A post-remix culture is fascinating to consider.2019 - Virtual Cinemawww.jwtintelligence.com&ndash;SharePick your own adventure books leaves behind the printed page and comes to a personalized theater of director free Nihilism near you?The Case for MusicEven in movies, there are moments where incidental non-soundtrack scores are a reflection of trying to envision the future. Beastie Boys is considered classical music in the latest reboot of the Star Trek universe. When I think about the future of music, the first artist that comes to mind is Aphex Twin. Of course, I’m not alone. 2007 - Freesound sample in &quot;Children of Men&quot; - Creative Commonscreativecommons.org&ndash;ShareWhile some of my favorite songs are remixes or interpretations by producers, I’ve not developed a taste for mashups yet. Regardless of my personal tastes, the remix culture is now over a decade old.

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;This week I made the pilgrimage to Las Vegas for Dell Technologies World and had the chance to take a lot of car services but none were via the sixteen (16) registered taxicab companies serving Las Vegas. Let’s take a look at ride-sharing in the city of sin and what is likely to be the future of getting around in just a few years.The trend is lots and lots of red...Trending DownNo matter what metric, the trends are all heading down for traditional taxi services in the Las Vegas area. From from the signage to the size of loading areas it was clear this week that transportation network companies (TNCs) were disrupting taxis at every turn.2019 - Ride-share use rising. Taxi usage plummetswww.reviewjournal.com&ndash;ShareDisruption will arrive in the form of a sedate sedan.Brief InterruptionsIt was only a few years ago that lawsuits and threats were the last refuge of the taxi companies. Time and technology was not on the side of the taxis.2014 - Potential roadblocks and market realitieswww.reviewjournal.com&ndash;ShareJust a few years ago, the primary coverage highlighted all the challenges and ignored the inevitable erosion of established market share.During the early years of TNC arrival in Las Vegas,  the only option for Uber pickup at the airport was as follows:stand in line for the the rental car bustake the bus to the rental car centerupon exiting the bus walk a block cross the intersection to the gas stationsummon an Uber (and hope)hopefully find shade at the gas station while you wait2015 - Licensing of ride-sharing driverswww.reviewjournal.com&ndash;ShareThe battle for access to McCarran International Airport is now just a footnote in history.The days of a complete geo location blocking screen for summoning an Uber is left to the history of those that saved screenshots.Need a Lyft?2019 - Some things never changewww.citylab.com&ndash;ShareC.R.E.A.M. is real.

        "excerpt":"&nbsp;Now that China has said “no thank you” to scrap recycling imports, there is a good chance the familiar cardboard recycling bin will take on greater significance as the piles… continue to make a bigger pile. This week, let’s take a look at the humble cardboard box.Humble OriginsOver the past 200 years there have been cardboard boxes big and small. The advent of global shipping and ever quickening supply chain technologies have only served to increase awareness of the cardboard box.1817 - Cardboard is bornen.wikipedia.org&ndash;Share200 years of boxes.From inception to meme took roughly 200 years for the cardboard box.

        "title": "Fudge Sunday - Private Podcasting and Max Headroom",
        "excerpt":"&nbsp;This week we take a look at the circuitous routes that podcasts have taken over the past 20 years. Along the way, we weave in references to tropes trove of Max Headroom. From origins to fits and starts to the claiming of legitimately enduring formats, podcasts are here to stay and probably just getting started even if the new world will be millions of Blank Reg devotees.Origin and InspirationPodcasts, like many technologies, scratched an itch of sorts. Internet friendly content formats, increasing availability of broadband, and the notions of publishing syndication made the trafficking of (then) larger files possible. Essentially, podcasts took the limited telephony access answering machines culture to a global delivery mechanism. Anyone can be their own radio station or their own publishing house with the invention of podcasting.1983 - They Might Be Giants Dial-A-Songtmbw.net&ndash;ShareWhen looking through the history of periodic or episodic audio syndication to wider audiences, the true originals might be argued to be the telephonic inspirations of TMBG.When looking at the proliferation of publishing from blogs to podcasts, the original dystopian view from “20 Minutes into the Future” and “Max Headroom” introduces the importance and ability for anyone to broadcast a signal into the void and find an audience.1985 - Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Futurewww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareThe original version from the UK.Eventually, Max Headroom came to US audiences just as the Internet was becoming increasingly mainstream. 1987 - Network 23 and Max Headroomwww.youtube.com&ndash;Share“We all work for the largest most powerful network in our world, Network 23. Doing whatever it takes to get that extra viewer… that larger TV rating…”Over the next 10 years, the Internet was increasingly shaped by web browsers. Sound in web browsers became a function of plug-ins. By 2000, a unique confluence of formats, creative technologists, and underlying transport possibilities came together to innovate. 2000 - The History of Podcastingen.wikipedia.org&ndash;ShareWell. It’s a history. There may be others but this is a good start to get a rough idea about timelines, prior art, and advances in technology.By 2005, Apple devices had native podcast support via iTunes. It would take until 2007 for HTML5 and the VIDEO tag freed streaming formats from the tyranny of the browser plug-in. Years later, appreciation for the vision and innovation of Max Headroom would become a 1 hour documentary and eventually an Internet love letter in the form a blog. 2010 - The Origin of Max Headroomwww.youtube.com&ndash;ShareIf you ever wondered about the world of Max Headroom… a full hour of background. Enjoy.2015 - Max Headroom: the definitive history of the 1980s digital iconwww.theverge.com&ndash;ShareThis is a long read but worth it if you want to see an example of long format blogging with a passion for the past.There Was an Attempt at MainstreamingApple has done a lot of work to control the experience for the end user and deliver on the platform approach to design aesthetics. While iTunes added support for podcasts in 2005, it would take another 7 years for Apple to give the humble podcast a more prominent location in iOS.2005 - Apple Takes Podcasting Mainstreamwww.apple.com&ndash;Share2012 - Apple releases dedicated Podcasts appwww.theverge.com&ndash;ShareThe slow and winding road to podcasting takes another turn.Oddly enough, just a few years after I turned off blog comments and began a my own personal retreat from various platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc. there was a brief but ultimately failed attempt to start my own podcast.2015 - Unicorn Jockeystwitter.com&ndash;ShareLooking back at the non-launch of the Unicorn Jockeys podcast.From a personal perspective, my voice appeared in podcasts as far back as 2010 and 2011 but these were radio formats first (Marketplace on NPR) and podcasts second. I’d been listening for far longer by then and saw the challenges of wide open Internet platforms repeating the same history as Usenet before it. Yes. Internet trolls had arrived. So, the safe silo enclave club experience version of Internet platforms was destined to appear again. Perhaps the podcast could be that new experience.Now and Soon and EventualitiesIn a time where deplatforming is a thing, it’s natural to expect the balkanization and privatization to continue in a variety of Internet formats and the services to support those formats.2008 - Balkanize, Rinse, Repeat ad infinitumjaycuthrell.com&ndash;ShareBack in 2008, it wasn’t uncommon to do your podcast listening in a web browser. Also, trolls were trolling, trolling, trolling, WHUT.Last year, even podcasting became a private label option for Enterprise buyers that wanted the ease of audio message syndication but with a more secure experience that avoids the pitfalls of wide open Internet viewing or listening.2018 - uStudio Enterprise Podcastingwww.prnewswire.com&ndash;ShareThe jump to Enterprise for podcast technologies is not that shocking when considering the insular private internal only corporate email list cultures that demanded it.When exclusivity of content and audience can be matched with an enabling technology, there are new market possibilities and funding will surely follow.2019 - The Dark Forest Theory of the Internetonezero.medium.com&ndash;ShareFast forward a few years, and the newest exclusive channels may be more populous than the colossal juggernauts we think of today.2019 - Investing in the Podcast Ecosystema16z.com&ndash;ShareThe a16z perspective is usually thoughtful and this post is no exception. Plus, a16z has slowly built a reputation for hosting great podcast guests as well.Maybe one day I’ll turn Fudge Sunday into an audio podcast and blow the dust off of the old Unicorn Jockeys website.  Until then, thanks again for subscribing. ","categories": [],
