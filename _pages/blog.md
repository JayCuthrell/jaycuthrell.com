My blog posts have been through a series of imports and exports over more than 20 years.

Originally, flat files, then they became WordPress (LAMP), OctoPress (LAMP), GitHub Pages, Revue (crudely imported), Netlify, Linode, etc... not to mention the various themes blender at this point. 

So please forgive any formatting issues especially from 2005-2012. 

Selected blog posts can be viewed at [https://fudge.org](https://fudge.org).
