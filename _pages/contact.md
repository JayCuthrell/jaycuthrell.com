There are many ways to contact me. This page updates as my [preferred methods evolve](https://ssd.eff.org/en). 
* I use and _prefer_ [Keybase](https://keybase.io/download). Search for [jaycuthrell](https://keybase.io/jaycuthrell).
* I also use [Signal](https://signal.org/install/). Search for +1-415-763-8343.
* I can also create an ephemeral virtual machine such as [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html), [Heads](https://heads.dyne.org/about.html), [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Main_Page), or [Hidden VM](https://github.com/aforensics/HiddenVM).

I also use telephone, SMS, and email but prefer to establish a second channel from the list above.
