Pre-Sales and Field CTO Summary
===============================

Pre-sales wins that I have been involved in span multiple segments such as service providers (telco, media, entertainment, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), independent software vendors (ISVs), independent hardware vendors (IHVs), systems integrators, various federal governments, United States SLED, various military, and various enterprise verticals. Types of enterprise wins I have been involved in include utilities, legal, construction, mining, manufacturing, finance, insurance, healthcare, textiles, automotive, retail, and more. 

My role in the pre-sales process and closing was and is to be a trusted advisor and road warrior aligned with the MEDDIC B2B sales qualification methodology. As a trusted advisor, my role was "soup to nuts" and holistic from qualification to bookings to post-sale "land and expand" account lifecycle management. Specifically, my pre-sales role involved high touch level strategy for credible product positioning, directed competitive analysis, RFx influencing, establishing success criteria for customer acceptance, cross-functional proof of concept test planning, C-level presentation in person in region globally, C-level presentations at executive briefing centers globally, ongoing C-level executive sponsorship 1:1 meetings at conference events, down to specific bill of materials and services contract creation through review and execution during delivery and implementation working with customer advocacy and customer success managers.

Since 2010, my field-facing pre-sales roles have meant virtual road warrior duties embracing both remote work techniques and leadership of remote teams. For example, as a virtual road warrior, the presentation experience involves the use of Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Slack, Cisco WebEx, and other virtual proxemics tools depending on the customer security posture requirements for virtual executive briefings.

README
======

Often, a README file can be a user manual for working together.

### Communication Style

- I have applied 50+ hours of versatile executive communication and facilitation courses by facilitating and leading 100+ meetings at executive briefing centers globally.
- I have been a remote worker since the late 1990s in diverse organizations with hybrid and on-site office environments.
- I am equally comfortable in 1:1 settings, analyst briefings, investor briefings, and large audiences be it virtually or on stage with a heavy speaking schedule at industry events and conferences.

### Personal Approach to Work

- I adapt and apply time management skills honed over decades of getting things done.
- I can rapidly synthesize insights and get the gist of situations with a bias for action to achieve the best outcome promptly.
- My approach to knowledge is to maintain a scribe persona with a notes knowledge base (Zettelkasten) that is survivable as part of succession planning, transfer of knowledge/information best practices, and orderly professional transition in and out of engagements (OPT-in and OPT-out).

### Preferred Communication Channels

- I time manage my calendar in 15-minute windows (Pomodoro Technique) and publish busy-free. I do not accept meeting invitations without fully formed agendas.
- For projects, I prefer standup meetings (SAFe/Agile/Scrum) in a chat environment (Slack/Teams/Discord/etc.) with a policy to go AV mode when richer context is essential and every 10 minutes I will move to cancel if there are no topics to discuss so the team can reclaim time.
- For anything requiring immediate attention, call my mobile.

### Feedback Preferences

- I believe that feedback is a gift that should be immediate in addition to being regularly scheduled with a structured format that creates opportunities for reflection and improvement.
- Feedback should enhance understanding between parties in such a way that group dynamics progress from responsive to effective to efficient teams.
- Feedback should support the goal of continuous improvement and timely course correction when required in the most timely manner possible.

### Personality Traits

- Most MTBI test results indicate I am a classic ENTJ.
- I typically conduct a quarterly reflection from my immediate network.
- I typically conduct a yearly 360-degree executive assessment.
- Personality type: [Commander (ENTJ-A)](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality)
- Traits:
  - Extraverted -- 71%
  - Intuitive -- 98%
  - Thinking -- 74%
  - Judging -- 90%
  - Assertive -- 88%
- Role: Analyst
- Strategy: People Mastery

### Leadership Philosophy

- Outcomes are what matters.
- Work is what is done, not where or how, in support of an outcome.
- Radical transparency and radical ownership are elemental to achieving outcomes.

### Management Style

- I believe that servant leadership with a bias for data-driven outcome-oriented decisions is the starting point for an effective management style.
- I believe that management styles must evolve, adapt, and adopt hybrid models based on changing business environments.
- I believe that Drucker's commentary on culture should drive product-led growth and sales-led growth organizations to embrace a management style that eats change for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks in between.

### Leadership Values and Principles

- I cascade clear crisp concise strategy to tactically innovative teams.
- I build and develop high-performing teams that operate independently.
- I provide transformational servant leadership in support of the teams in my charge.
