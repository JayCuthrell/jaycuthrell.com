title: "About me"

---

Back in the mid to late 90s the first computers I was paid to work on were made by Dell. IIRC, they were Dell XPS P100 with a Buslogic SCSI card and a DEC Tulip Ethernet card running Slackware and Red Hat Linux.

Presently, I am in a servant-leader role as a Managing Director at Dell Technologies.

The _hindsight 20/20 storytelling_ goes something like this... but my meandering career path was anything but planned.

* I was born and raised in Beaufort, North Carolina. 
* Eventually, I graduated from North Carolina State University with a BS in Materials Science and Engineering. 
* After my co-op at IBM doing TCP/IP benchmarking in development data centers, I dropped out of graduate school to be a digital nomad. 
* My first consulting roles involved nascent LAMP stacks for web based OAM&P at Nortel using Dell hardware in production data centers and side-gigs with stealth startups. 
* By 1999, I was consulting at Fortune 500 companies while managing software engineers and infrastructure architects for boutique .com consulting firms in state of the art production data centers, peering points, and colo's around the globe. 
* By 2002, I was hired as CTO at NeoNova to digitally transform and grow a business that mangages Internet services and data center for telecommunications companies. 
* By 2007, I was hired as VP, GM, and CTO at Digitel to digitally transform and grow a business that manages converged voice and data services in remote data centers for VARs. 
* By 2009, I launched [Cuthrell Consulting LLC](https://cuthrell.com) to revisit my digital nomad roots of consulting, advising startups, and blogging.
* In 2009, the Acadia and the Virtual Computing Environment coalition are created by Cisco and EMC with additional investments from VMware and Intel.
* In 2010, as luck would have it, I met some folks working for Acadia and I joined the team thinking it would be a year long engagement. 
* By late 2010, Acadia and the Virtual Computing Environment coalition combine to form VCE. 
* By 2012, VCE approached $0.5 Billion Annual Run Rate. 
* By 2013, VCE reached $1 Billion Annual Run Rate. 
* By late 2013, VCE reached $1.8 Billion Annual Run Rate. 
* By October 2014, VCE is considered to be the most successful joint venture in IT history. 
* By 2015, VCE exceeded $3.0 Billion Annual Run Rate and becomes an EMC Company. 
* In October 2015, Dell and EMC agree to largest merger in IT history for a reported $67 Billion. 
* Today, I get to serve amazing team members all over the world working at the intersection of technology and human progress.
