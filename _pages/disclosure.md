Here are my disclosures that I make reasonable attempts to keep current. While I do not maintain an exhausive list of online presences here I will make reasonable attempts to link to this disclosure when the UI/UX of a given service permits or I will state that the opinions shared on those third party services are solely mine.

In general, the words, images, or what can be summed up as a variety of purposeful output found at this website and elsewhere on the Internets are my opinions. These momentary captures of the vortex of consciousness and mutable communications reflect my opinions and not those of anything or anyone else. That’s what many folks like to call a disclaimer. This disclaimer is mine. It’s pretty fancy if I do say so myself. Which I just did.

### Content

This is my primary personal website and other variations elsewhere on the Internet are non-authoritative and considered deprecated.

There is a link to this disclaimer and my disclosure(s) within the footer of each page and before the content of each post here unless rendering that disclaimer is impacted by noodling with my content management system du jour. Read it. Know it. Love it.

I reserve the right to change my mind and edit content at any time. Any CMS changelog here is subject to client side edits or server side edits on GitHub as delivered by _bundle exec jekyll build_ or _gatsby build_ or _yarn build_.

I was a prolific account creator and comment maker across the Interwebs — yes, even [Twitter](/on-twitter/). If there is any ambiguity around me making the comment or not, please consider the rather loose concepts around comment vetting, data ownership, data portability, and non-repudiation before you assume a comment is truly mine. Just ask me. Never assume.

I was a guest contributor at Telecompetitor and a writer for ReadWrite in addition to being published in a technology trade journal. However, the majority of my publishing output is behind corporate firewalls.

Any personal profiles on Twitter, LinkedIn, or other services on the Internet are placeholders, non-authoritative, considered deprecated, and superceded by my [website](/) and claimed verfications on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/jaycuthrell).

I maintain an active personal profile on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/jaycuthrell) where I can be [contacted](/contact/).

### My Employers, Clients, and Customers

I am presently in a Managing Director role at [Dell Technologies](http://www.delltechnologies.com).

My [CV / resumé is available exclusively on this website](/resume/).

### Startups

At present, I am no longer an advisor to any startups.

I was an advisor to amazing startups were funded, acqired, and ones that did not survive.

With all startups I advise, the equity I have is commensurate with my involvement level.

I have published [a blog post that outlines how I work with startups and my fuller thoughts on taking an advisory role](/be-my-advisor/) which I also link back to on [my AngelList profile](https://angel.co/jaycuthrell).

### Positions

I may actively trade in the stock market. When I produce content on this website I will disclose my position or interest in reference by linking to this positions statement. 

I invest primarily in mutual funds and index funds but may also participate in automatic rebalancing services such as Wealthfront. If you are interested, this [Wealthfront invitation referral link](http://wlth.fr/1RjvsX3) may provide you with a discount and/or advisory fee relief in addition to lowering my own advisory fees. Be sure to read all the fine print from [Wealthfront disclosures](https://www.wealthfront.com/legal/disclosure) (as of May 2015) therein. YMMV.

I’ll spare you the reporting on how my portfolio is doing. I’m not an investment professional. Do your own homework and remember that everything you are reading here and elsewhere from me does not constitute investment advice in any way shape or form.

### Gifts and Advertising

I refuse gifts when possible. However, I’m often presented with random tchotchke bags and the occasional high dollar gadget or two when attending conferences and events. If items are worth more than $5 or something I can’t take notes on (e.g. pens and paper) I attempt to donate or [recycle](https://www.bestbuy.com/recycle) the items. I explained this in more detail on an old [free phones](/free-phones/) post after attending a gratis Google I/O event.

I’m always experimenting with ways to monetize web content. I’ve used Google Adsense, Text Link Ads, Adbrite, Amazon Affiliates, etc… but I always end up taking them down after I’m familiar with the concepts. At best I’ve made $100 or so here and there.
